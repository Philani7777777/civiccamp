_Guest post by John Stephens, Facilitator, Mediator and Teacher at UNC-Chapel Hill_

CIOs for local government, universities, and larger nonprofits are the new translators and innovators of our age. IT is not simply an overlay to existing business processes. They help re-think and re-do public service delivery. On top of that, open data along with analytics and the transparency movements, is pushing more questions about data about what, for who, for which set of goals.

I’m pleased to moderate a panel of CIOs on Friday, September 23 at CityCamp NC. I’ve been studying civic technology and the roles of IT/design volunteers – through brigades, or “Code for…” groups. These CIO leaders will help all of us assess where we are and the best opportunities for community-government collaboration. In addition to that, we want to explore where these CIOs see opportunities for citizens to participate as well as the positive effect of open data for their respective organizations.

The public sector CIO panel at CityCamp NC includes the following participants:

  * Bill Greeves, Wake County CIO
  * Leah Kraus, NC Central University CIO
  * Jane Nickles, Greensboro CIO
  * Darnell Smith, City of Raleigh CIO
