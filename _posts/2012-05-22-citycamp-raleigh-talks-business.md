The best thing about CityCamp is that it brings together citizens, government officials, and business leaders into one place for a weekend to brainstorm on ways for our city and county to be an even better place to live, work, and play.  While the event is officially an &#8220;[unconference](http://citycampral.org/2012/05/so-what-is-an-unconference-anyway/ "So, what is an unconference anyway?"),&#8221; Friday will be a little more structured with a few speaker panels.  Learn more about the business panel from our Project Manager, Jason Hibbets.
