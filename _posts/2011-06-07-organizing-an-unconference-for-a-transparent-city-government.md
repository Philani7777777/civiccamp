Organizing an unconference is easy if you&#8217;ve got passionate people with the right talent, leaders with a strong vision, and the right organizational tools chosen by the team. Typically, it&#8217;s a group of volunteers who come together and self-organize into a community of passion. This was also the case for the first CityCamp Raleigh, being held June 3-5.

CityCamp is an <a title="unconference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference" target="_blank">unconference</a> focused on innovation for municipal governments and community organizations. CityCamp Raleigh is three days of open sourced talks, workshops, and hands-on problem solving, to re-imagine the way the web, applications, technology, and participation will shape the future of our city.<!--more-->

The team that I helped organize did an awful lot of planning for an unconference. And we faced a big challenge from the start—none of us had ever been to a CityCamp, much less planned one. Furthermore, none of us had even been to an unconference. The desire to improve our city with open government, open data, manageable transparency, and useful technology to bring together city employees, developers, and citizens to collaborate on solutions drove the planning team to a successful event.

The idea started on Twitter, shortly after I posted an article exploring how Raleigh, NC could be the <a title="Raleigh, NC—the world's first open source city" href="http://opensource.com/government/11/2/raleigh-nc-worlds-first-open-source-city" target="_blank">open source hub of the world</a>. After a few tweets between <a title="@govloop" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/govloop" target="_blank">@govloop</a>, <a title="@kmcurry" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/kmcurry" target="_blank">@kmcurry</a>, and <a title="@bonnergaylord" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/bonnergaylord" target="_blank">@bonnergaylord</a> in early March 2011, Bonner Gaylord and I were committed to organizing a <a title="CityCamp in Raleigh" href="../" target="_blank">CityCamp in Raleigh</a>.
