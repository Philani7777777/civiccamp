Every year at CityCamp NC we have a great round of speakers. From our lightning talks on the opening night to our keynotes and panel discussions there is always something for everyone interested in hearing more about opportunities and resources available for community collaboration.

To help give an idea of what to expect from CityCamp NC, we wanted to highlight some of the talks and keynote from last year&#8217;s CityCamp NC that was held June 12-13, 2015 in Raleigh at HQ Raleigh and Wake County Commons. The videos below are only a few of the speakers, so we encourage you to look into our [CityCamp NC YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsD0j-2T5Q_kpz_5CJVxxZoG2jHDGoICB) for all the recordings from last year&#8217;s talks.

Mark came to the Triangle to share his thoughts and insights in the area of civic technology and open government and left getting a better understanding of the civic hacking scene in NC.
