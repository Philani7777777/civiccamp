Team &#8211; I added the first draft of the <a title="Project Plan" href="/project-plan/" target="_blank">project plan</a> to the site today. I&#8217;ve outlined several committees that I think will help make this event successful. We should discuss this draft and the committees at the <a title="CityCamp meet-up | Monday, April 11, 2011" href="http://www.meetup.com/GovLoop/Raleigh-NC/87216/" target="_blank">next meet-up</a>.

As far as the business plan is concerned, I focused on getting a solid <a title="About CityCamp Raleigh" href="/about/" target="_blank">description</a> of the event and adding in a purpose statement. I think the purpose statement defines what sponsors and attendees will get out of the event.

> The purpose is to highlight the power of participation, promote open source in local government, and explore how technology is used to increase government transparency. CityCamp Raleigh will foster communities of practice and create outcomes for participants both during, and after the event.

If we think this sounds good, we should move forward with it and not spend too much time wordsmithing. We have a lot of things to focus on.<!--more-->

Here are the other committees that I think we need to form beyond the planning / steering committee:

  * Sponsorship committee
  * Marketing committee
  * Speaker committee
  * Logistics committee

I&#8217;ll be looking for other folks to step up and lead these committees. As your project manager, I&#8217;ll do my best to keep everyone on track and focused. We have just over 50 days to pull this off.

_Update on location:_ It looks like we can get the Convention Center on Friday, June 3rd and Sunday, June 5th. Unfortunately, Saturday, June 4th, is booked with events. We are looking to see if the Sheraton is available. Otherwise, we&#8217;ll have to look for somewhere else. Personally, I&#8217;d at least like to kick the event off at the Convention Center for the Friday sessions.
