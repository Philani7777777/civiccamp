Problem solving is the core of what most technology developers work at on a daily basis. A mountain of data is meaningless unless we put it to some use. So what CityCamp will attempt to do is to take data from government and put it in the hands of mobile app developers, web programmers, software writers and many more technology enthusiasts to see what kind of cool stuff we as a group can come up with.&nbsp;This is a great opportunity for those with skills on the keys to create something that citizens can use.

The technology portion of CityCamp is really geared towards those who already spend time creating apps and software to make their digital lives easier. Instead of spending a weekend updating your Linux computer to Natty Narwhal, bring your skills to CityCamp to create transit apps, data visualization projects, information subscriptions, anything to help better Raleigh. You also might meet some pretty cool people during the weekend.

The real interesting thing here is that government officials are willing to bring out the data to give these apps some life. During CityCamp, representatives from Raleigh government will be there and are open to the idea of developers using the city&#8217;s data for the creation of better services. Think of the possibilities of what can be created with open data about transit, parks, infrastructure coming straight from the city itself. This is the treasure that can make the apps really shine.

The collaboration between the tech savvy and idea filled citizen is nothing new. I would encourage any readers to check out [Code For America](http://codeforamerica.org/), a non-profit that partners with talented individuals who&#8217;s skills with web applications can be used for solving some of governments toughest problems. This collaborative effort moves toward making our cities more transparent and more efficient with better solutions. You can take what you are already good at and put it towards solving problems in your community. It&#8217;s a great public service.

I invite any talented developers in Raleigh to participate and help turn ideas into working solutions.
