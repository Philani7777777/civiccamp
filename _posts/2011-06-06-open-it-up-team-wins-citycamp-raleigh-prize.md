June 6, 2011: CityCamp Raleigh, the first city-focused “unconference” in North Carolina that brings together government, business, neighborhood, non-profit, and academic communities working toward next generation solutions for Raleigh.

CityCamp Raleigh organizers estimate that over 225 ‘campers’ attended over the three-day event and over 54 ideas and 524 votes were cast on the [Google moderator site](http://bit.ly/iWPSyH). In addition to a follow up event in 2012, organizers are planning Meetups to keep the momentum going and a citycampral.org Wiki to keep the discussion moving forward. Feedback for the first CityCamp Raleigh was overwhelmingly positive.

Eight teams presented on June 5, 2011, for the $5000 prize. The prize was awarded on creativity, execution, and feasibility. “The Open It Up team epitomized the CityCamp Raleigh event,” said Jason Hibbets a CityCamp Raleigh committee co-chair and judge. “The issue was mentioned in the panel on Friday by Jimmy Goodmon as a parental concern, stated by a government employee in a breakout session on Saturday morning, and a team of strangers came together to propose and prototype a technology solution by the end of the following day.”

The team utilized the NC educational report card data currently available via static HTML web pages or available via Microsoft Access database on a CD if you pay ten dollars. Open It Up utilizes the current static information to leverage open format data and demonstrate rapid deployment possibilities. The working prototype, developed in less than two days, is available at <http://ncopendata.org/>
