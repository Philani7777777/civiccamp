CityCamp Raleigh will host a meetup on November 28, 2011, 7:00 pm at Draft on Glenwood Avenue. (<a title="510 Glenwood Avenue, Raleigh, NC" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Draft,+Glenwood+Avenue,+Raleigh,+NC&hl=en&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=58.72842,105.292969&vpsrc=0&hq=Draft,+Glenwood+Avenue,+Raleigh,+NC&t=m&z=15" target="_blank">510 Glenwood Avenue, Raleigh, NC</a>).

We invite all CityCampers and anyone interested in changing the way the web, applications, technology, and participation will shape the future of Raleigh. This includes citizens, developers, techies, govies, and more—really, as long as you have a passion for open government or even if you&#8217;re just curious about it, we hope you can attend. Here are a few topics for the November 28 meetup:<!--more-->

  * TriangleWiki
  * GeoPortal
  * Hackathon – January 2012
  * City of Raleigh Open government/Open source systems resolution
  * Open topics from attendees

For this meetup, Raleigh CityCampers would like to tell you about a new project that is underway, TriangleWiki. You may have read about this in the <a title="Something Wiki this way comes, contributors sought" href="http://www.midtownraleighnews.com/2011/11/15/10051/something-wiki-this-way-comes.html" target="_blank">Midtown</a>. Now it&#8217;s your chance to meet the folks who are making TriangleWiki happen and prepare the project for a 2012 launch.

We also will have a representative from the Raleigh GIS team  to give a walk through of the new GeoPortal. It provides access to the various web services that underly iMaps and allows others to use those same web services in a programmatic way, as well as to do static data downloads. It is an open source front end to ESRI.

There may be some rumors out there about a CityCamp sponsored Hackathon in January 2012. If this sounds like something interesting to you, this will be a perfect venue for CityCampers to discuss and commit to making this event happen. We&#8217;d also like to give a brief update on the City of Raleigh Open government/Open source systems resolution now that election season is over.

Finally, we like the “unmeetup” approach where attendees can gather and discuss topics that are interesting to them. We know everyone is busy and want to leave time for people to network and connect with folks who are working on projects to help advance our open government efforts.
