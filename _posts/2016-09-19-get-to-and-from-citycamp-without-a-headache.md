**The Citycamp NC experience starts when you head out to the event &#8211; and we, on the planning team, want to make it an easy one.** 

With the event taking place at Nash Hall in downtown Raleigh, there are a few key pointers that can save you some time and trouble when getting to and from the event.

### 1. Finding Nash Hall

Nash Hall is the main gathering space of [Church on Morgan](http://churchonmorgan.com/) and we couldn&#8217;t be any happier to partner with them as our hosts for this year&#8217;s event _(Thanks again, you&#8217;re awesome!)_. Point your maps and devices to [136 East Morgan Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/136+E+Morgan+St,+Raleigh,+NC+27601/@35.7793312,-78.639001,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89ac5f6d09623cf9:0x1b4ddf5bd9c24d37!8m2!3d35.7793312!4d-78.6368123?hl=en-US) in order to get there.

&nbsp;

### 2. Parking

For those driving, the [Wilmington Station Parking Deck](http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/go/wilmington-street-parking-deck) is the most convenient option as it is on the same block. For more parking options, check out the [Downtown Raleigh Alliance](http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/get-around/parking/parking-decks) for more information.

&nbsp;

### 3. Bikers & transit riders

Two-wheeled citycampers can also lock up in the Wilmington Station Parking Deck as there are covered racks along Blount Street. (literally 100 feet from the front door!)

If you&#8217;re using public transit to maneuver around, there are plenty of nearby bus stops and Moore Square, central transit hub, is within walking distance to Nash Hall. To get schedule and route information go to the <a href="http://www.gotriangle.org/" target="_blank">GoTriangle website</a>, or download the <a href="http://translocrider.com/" target="_blank">Rider app</a>.

&nbsp;

_**Be Aware!**_ Downtown will have a variety of events going on with the largest being Capital City Bikefest. This festival will close down all of nearby Fayetteville Street on Friday and Saturday so depending on your route, you may experience a detour. **Morgan Street,** where Citycamp will be, **will not be closed**. To navigate around Bikefest, you can see their <a href="http://www.capitalcitybikefest.com/about-us/venue-map-parking-info" target="_blank">event map here</a> but access to the Wilmington Station Deck (both entrances) and our event _will be open_.

&nbsp;

See our quick map which we&#8217;ve put together below.



&nbsp;

Lastly, if you want to further prepare, I cannot recommend the Downtown Raleigh App enough. It is helpful to get around, find parking, and any other places in downtown Raleigh that are taking place. <a href="http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/get-around/app" target="_blank">See more about that here</a>.
