On [Saturday, May 31](http://citycampnc.org/2014/05/citycamp-nc-schedule-for-saturday-may-31/ "CityCamp NC Schedule for Saturday, May 31"), CityCampers gathered at William Peace University for the CityCamp NC civic hackathon. This was one of more than 120 events <a title="hacking for change" href="http://hackforchange.org/" target="_blank">hacking for change</a>, part of the National Day of Civic Hacking, a coordinated movement sponsored by the White House to encourage communities around the nation to participate in their local government. Most of the hackathon time was spent working on the team projects and presentations, but a few civic hackers helped out with other projects, such as working on a Google Fiber interest form for the City of Raleigh.

At 4:00 pm, a sizeable crowd of almost 60 people gathered in the lecture hall at the Flowe Building on William Peace University campus to view the presentations. Here were the five teams that competed:

  * **Wake County To The Trails App** — Implemented the open source “To The Trails” App from Code for America for Wake County. The application provides an easy to use map interface. It is responsive (works on desktop, tablets, and mobile) and explored adding an engagement piece to allow users to post comments (downed trees, debris, tough climb, etc.)
  * **Activate Spaces** — Mapping Raleigh vacant spaces with crowdsourced data. Check out their <a title="Activate Spaces" href="http://citycampnc.org/get-involved/2014-2/activate/" target="_blank">prototype</a>.
  * **FreeWheeling NC** — Influence planning and healthy communities through real-time crowdsourced bike routes that people use, using bikes as transportation vs. recreation. Also influence upcoming Raleigh Bike share program. Check out their work on <a title="freewheelingnc.raleighacorn.com" href="http://freewheelingnc.raleighacorn.com/" target="_blank">freewheelingnc.raleighacorn.com</a>.
  * **Raleigh Engage** — Building a  engagement website for the City of Raleigh on NationBuilder.
  * **Re-humanize** — Improve employment for ex-offenders.
