    Street Closures in downtown Raleigh Thursday evening through Saturday.

</div>

We&#8217;re excited about this year&#8217;s CityCamp NC and continuing to host it in downtown Raleigh. With a September event, however, there&#8217;s are always other events going on, big and small. This year&#8217;s CityCamp NC falls on the same weekend as the International Bluegrass Festival that Raleigh is hosting. Street festivals and other outdoor performances will result in street closures but that shouldn&#8217;t impact any CityCamp NC events.

&nbsp;

Here&#8217;s our breakdown of the weekend to help you navigate your way in and out of downtown Raleigh even with some streets being closed.

We highly recommend downloadingÂ the [downtown Raleigh appÂ ](http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/get-around/app)which is helpful with seeing road closures, downtown circulator information, and parking.

#### Thursday Evening

Our CityCamp NC kickoff is at [HQ Raleigh&#8217;s Cannon Room](https://www.hqcapitalclub.com/the-cannon-room) in the Capital Club building. This is not to be confused with their Harrington Street location in the warehouse district nearby.

On the evening of 9/28, Martin Street in front of HQ Raleigh will be closed as crews prepare for the festivities the next day. Our recommendation is to navigate straight to a parking deck and walk two or three blocks to the Cannon Room. Possible locations would be:

  * [Moore Square Parking Deck](http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/go/moore-square-parking-deck)
  * [Wilmington Station Parking Deck](http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/go/wilmington-street-parking-deck)
  * [Wake County Parking Deck](http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/go/wake-county-parking-deck)

If you need to make a drop-off first, our recommendation is to drive to [235 South Salisbury Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/235+S+Salisbury+St,+Raleigh,+NC+27601/@35.7773042,-78.6404896,186m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89ac5f71f9cddb37:0xafc2858d94ee42fa!8m2!3d35.7773042!4d-78.6399424). That puts you around the corner from HQ Raleigh, away from the closed streets. Try and stay away from the tasty treats at Lucettegrace! ðŸ˜‰

#### Friday

All of Friday&#8217;s day-time activities will be at [Nash Hall @ Church on Morgan](http://churchonmorgan.com/). The most convenient place to park is next door at theÂ [Wilmington Station Parking Deck](http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/go/wilmington-street-parking-deck).

##### Friday Evening Social at Google Fiber

After our event ends at 5pm, we invite all attendees to join us at Google Fiber at 5:30 who is hosting us for drinks and heavy eats. It is a nice, 20 minute walk but we recognize that it may not be convenient for everyone.



If driving, nearby parking to Google Fiber includes:

  * [Powerhouse Square Parking Deck](http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/go/powerhouse-square-parking-deck)
  * [222 Glenwood Parking Deck](http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/go/222-glenwood-parking-deck)

&nbsp;

The downtown circulator, the R-Line, has a stop one-block away from Church on Morgan and one block away from Google Fiber. You can track the buses on the [downtown Raleigh app](http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/get-around/app).

Other alternatives are cabs, pedicabs, and carpooling. Let us know if there are any questions as we want to make this transition between venues as smooth as possible.
