  * Submit a poster design to promote the adopt-a-shelter program
  * Create Triangle Wiki pages about existing bus shelters
  * Enhance the adopta app by fixing bugs and working on feature request (Ruby of Rails developers wanted)

After the civic-athon at the Urban Design Center, the group will visit <a href="https://trianglewiki.org/Raleigh_Bus_Stop_R9_Municipal_Complex" target="_blank">Raleigh bus shelter R9</a> at 11:45 AM to unveil a newly adopted shelter owner in downtown Raleigh.

**We hope you can join us on December 1.**
