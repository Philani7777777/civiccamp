Lot&#8217;s of momentum this week and a small fire helping to motivate everyone: 37 days until the event.We&#8217;ve passed the go/no-go date for the week of June 3, 4, and 5th. **The first ever CityCamp Raleigh is a go**. We are moving forward with reserving space, signing up speakers, and securing <a title="sponsorships" href="/sponsors/" target="_blank">sponsorships</a>.

We made some great progress this week including confirming space for Friday and Saturday at Vintage 21. We are also looking at securing space for Sunday, June 5th, at the Stockroom from Empire properties.

On the speaker side of things, we are starting to secure speakers including<!--more-->

<a title="Michael Tiemann" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tiemann" target="_blank">Michael Tiemann</a> from Red Hat. I am trying to see if Jim Whitehurst is available to keynote and Hilary is trying to contact Bob Young. No one has stepped up to lead the speaker committee. _You?_ For now it&#8217;s lead by committee and after we secure our speakers, it will be a matter of scheduling the Friday afternoon session and coordinating with the logistics committee. Reid is looking to get a speaker from SAS who worked on the City of Raleigh crime data. Jonathan is looking to get Gail Roper and someone from GIS to speak.

The marketing committee is meeting on Wednesday of this week and has a marketing plan in the works. We will really start to see a push on the first week of May to start spreading the word about the event. They are also working with two designers, Christine and Hex, who are helping create an identity and logo options for CityCamp Raleigh.

We talked a lot about sponsorships tonight. The first thing we need to get done is convert the draft sponsorship prospectus to a more finalized version and get it on the website—asap. We also think it&#8217;s critical to get Red Hat&#8217;s name on the sponsor list as it will be a catalyst to get other&#8217;s involved. We have a list of other potential sponsors that we&#8217;d like to target and would be a good fit for the event. We think we could pull off the event for about $10k, which includes renting space, providing food for 3 days, and other logistic / collaboration stuff. At this point, we are not paying speakers and we will not charge attendee&#8217;s for the event. Of course, we&#8217;d like to do more with the event, such as offer a prize purse / award to a group who can develop a web application in the spirit of open government.

Damon Circosta stepped up to help handle money for the event. All funding from sponsorships will go through the North Carolina Center for Voter Education, which has 501 (3)-c status, and CityCamp Raleigh will have a sub account there. This will be a great help to CityCamp Raleigh.

The logistics committee is getting ramped up and will be the lifeblood of the actual event. After they get a good feel for the space at Vintage 21, the next big task is to create a registration form for users. We want to get an accurate headcount and registration will provide an incentive for people to attend as space is limited. They are also going to investigate Internet availability at both Vintage 21 and The Stockroom. Finding volunteers to help at the event also came up.

One of the last topics that came up, and probably a very important one, was why? Why CityCamp Raleigh? What&#8217;s the hook?

I think CityCamp Raleigh is part of a larger vision for Raleigh to be an open source city. It&#8217;s about attracting the creative class, open source talent, and the companies who understand the open source way. This is an economic development strategy that fits in with Raleigh&#8217;s culture. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m doing this—because open source and open government are a better way to do things.
