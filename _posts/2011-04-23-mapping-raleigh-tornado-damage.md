Over at Raleigh Public Record, Charles C. Duncan Pardo has [posted a map that plots data](http://www.raleighpublicrecord.org/featured/2011/04/22/mapping-raleigh-tornado-damage/) supplied by the City of Raleigh inspections department. This map makes it easy to get an overview of the damage as well as zoom in for house-by-house info.
