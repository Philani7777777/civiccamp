What was [CityCamp Raleigh](http://www.newraleigh.com/articles/archive/citycamp-raleigh-announces-5000-prize/) all about? It depends on who you ask&#8230;

Our website says: “CityCamp Raleigh is three days of open sourced talks, workshops, and hands-on problem solving to re-imagine the way the web, applications, technology, and participation will shape the future of Raleigh. CityCamp brings together government, business, neighborhood, non-profit, and academic communities to work toward next generation solutions for Raleigh.”

For [Leo Suarez](http://dtraleigh.com/2011/06/citycamp-raleigh-follow-up-and-the-council-to-discuss-open-source/), CityCamp Raleigh made him<!--more-->

_&#8220;inspired and motivated to demand that our city, county, and state open up more data to the public for our consumption.&#8221;_

For [Jonathan Minter](http://citycampral.org/2011/06/things-i-learned-from-citycamp-raleigh/), CityCamp taught him a few things, including (finally) the value of twitter and _&#8220;that there is a passionate group of citizens who are willing to not just talk about the problems our city faces – but are also willing to roll up their sleeves and get to work solving them.&#8221;_

For [David Both](http://www.both.org/?p=454), CityCamp Raleigh was _&#8220;a perfect example of how Open Source works.&#8221;_

For [Jason Hibbets](http://citycampral.org/2011/06/organizing-an-unconference-for-a-transparent-city-government/),  Raleigh&#8217;s _&#8220;community of passion for a more open and transparent government&#8221; and the &#8220;collaboration of individuals who are excited to be a part of this movement has trumped time and challenges.&#8221;_

For Jason Horne (on Gov 2.0 Radio), CityCamp Raleigh was [this](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/gov20/2011/06/06/citycamp-raleigh).

For [David Warlick](http://citycampral.org/2011/05/open-data-and-ideas-a-treasure-trove-for-developers-at-citycamp-raleigh/), events like CityCamp Raleigh are moving towards making _&#8220;our cities more transparent and more efficient with better solutions.&#8221;_

For [Cris Mulder](http://thertpblog.org/2011/06/07/citycamp-raleigh-%E2%80%93-building-leadership-to-create-change/), CityCamp Raleigh _&#8220;provided a working foundation and understanding of technology, transparency, collaboration, and open source in government, while at the same time highlighting the importance of citizen participation&#8221;_

For me, CityCamp Raleigh was about redefining how we can work together. I have been on all kinds of teams&#8230; Baseball teams, basketball teams, football teams, soccer teams, project teams, mission teams, ultimate Frisbee teams, a water-ski team, and an Olympics Team (Olympics of the Mind, but that still counts).

I have not been on many great teams. On that water-ski team, we did an exhibition for the girls camp and I almost hit a wooden piling and busted in front of a crowd of girls. While showing our balsa structure during the Olympics (of the Mind), one of my teammates kicked it and it collapsed. Once, I took a basketball full court for a runaway layup scoring two points for the opponent.  These were not great teams.

CityCamp Raleigh was a great team.  Unlike any team I have been involved with in the past this team formed around a seed planted on Twitter:****

  * **Jason Hibbets (@jhIbbets): **@govfresh @kmcurry I&#8217;m game for @CityCamp in Raleigh &#8211; let me know how I can help********
  * **Me (@bonnergaylord):** @jhibbets @govfresh Just spoke with @kmcurry about @CityCamp yesterday! Let&#8217;s do this&#8230; Chat later?

Thus began a great team that changed the way I think about technology, government, data, citizens, and the idea of “open source.” Mostly though, this experience changed the way I believe we can work together.

For CityCamp Raleigh, a group of strangers self-formed around a kernel of an idea to create a 3-day conference without personal benefit within a few short weeks. I have never seen this before&#8230;A singular and alien idea was floating in space until in some pseudo-zygotic development, twelve people coalesced, self-organized, self-delegated, and then executed their collective plan.

CityCamp Raleigh showed me the power of an idea and the power of individuals formed around that idea. If you want to know exactly what happened there, see the articles already posted above, there’s not much more I can say.

I’m more interested in the next great idea and the next team.
