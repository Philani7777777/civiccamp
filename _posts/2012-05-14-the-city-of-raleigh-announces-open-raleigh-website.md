The City of Raleigh recently established a website at [www.raleighnc.gov/open](http://www.raleighnc.gov/open) &#8211; another step in fulfilling the open source and open data resolution passed by the City Council. This page:

  * serves as a clearinghouse of open data and open source resources for the City of Raleigh organization
  * includes a new service called &#8220;MyRaleigh Ideas!&#8221; that we will be using to gather feedback on important apps and data sets that will help us prioritize what data sets to publish. Later on, we&#8217;ll be rolling out MyRaleigh Ideas! for other citizen engagements throughout the city
  * includes links to other resources, such as the TriangleWiki page that lists open data resources throughout the community

You can also read the [press release](http://www.raleighnc.gov/home/news/content/CorNews/Articles/OpenRaleigh.html).

Please visit [MyRaleigh Ideas!](https://raleigh.granicusideas.com/open) and add your ideas to the site. How would you like to see city data used in our community? And vote on other ideas while you are there so we can see which ideas float to the top.

Then come to [CityCamp Raleigh 2012](http://citycampral.org/2012/04/announcing-citycamp-raleigh-2012/) and help make these ideas a reality!
