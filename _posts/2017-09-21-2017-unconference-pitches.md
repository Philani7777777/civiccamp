No trust falls, I promise. On the afternoon of Friday, September 29, CityCampers attend the unconference portion of the event. For those of you new to this format, let&#8217;s explore this a bit (below). For those CityCamp NC veterans, we ask that you share some of you unconference session ideas on this GitHub issue: [Pitch your CityCamp NC issue here](https://github.com/codeforraleigh/NCOpenPass/issues/693) and we&#8217;ll list it on our [schedule](http://citycampnc.org/schedule/) as a proposed unconference session.

On Friday, September 29, after the Smart Cities Panel, [keynote presentation](http://citycampnc.org/2017/08/30/the-secrets-to-urbanism-and-open-data/), and other featured talks, we&#8217;ll have our unconference pitches. This means that anyone attending CityCamp NC can fill out a pitch form and will get up to 60-seconds to pitch a session topic. These topics could range from timely discussions on local/state government, something you&#8217;re passionate about, forming an open data competition team, or one of our three NC Open Pass challenges.

We typically get somewhere between 20-30 pitches on a variety of topics. For example, see our [attendee created agenda](http://citycampnc.org/2016/09/23/friday-september-23-unconference-schedule-the-grid/) from last year. You can see it included topics such as open 511, carpool vote, sustainable tech, GitHub 101, open data 101, and many others. We&#8217;ll have room for 16-20 sessions. But in order for that to happen, we need you to [attend](http://citycampnc.org/register/) and share your thoughts on topics that can help advance and improve our respective communities.

So now that you&#8217;ve got the skinny, if you [submit a proposal](https://github.com/codeforraleigh/NCOpenPass/issues/693), we&#8217;ll list it on our [schedule](http://citycampnc.org/schedule/) as a proposed unconference session. You must be present **and** pitch to be considered. We can&#8217;t wait to see you&#8217;re ideas!
