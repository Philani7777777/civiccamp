We wanted to let you know about next week&#8217;s <a title="TriDUG (Drupal User Group)" href="http://groups.drupal.org/tridug" target="_blank">TriDUG (Drupal User Group)</a> meetup on Wednesday, November 16, 2011 starting at 6:30PM, hosted at Red Hat. The agenda is below and if you&#8217;re planning on attending, RSVP at <a title="http://www.meetup.com/triDUG/events/40479742/" href="http://www.meetup.com/triDUG/events/40479742/" target="_blank">meetup.com</a>.

This is actually part two of a series TriDUG is hosting about using Drupal with non-profits. Last month, Drupalers were introduced to <a title="SpringBoard" href="http://drupal.org/project/springboard" target="_blank">SpringBoard</a> followed by a presentation from <a title="Hesketh.com" href="http://hesketh.com/" target="_blank">Hesketh.com</a> on working with clients. Next week, TriDUG has more of the same great stuff.<!--more-->
