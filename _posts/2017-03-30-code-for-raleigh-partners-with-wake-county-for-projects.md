Code for Raleigh [hosted a fantastic meet-up](https://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Code-for-America/events/238510733/) earlier this week on Monday, March 27. It was great to see lots of new faces and get feedback on the [proposed initiatives and projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19TjiXkpGlXDWX4_Vx9CKCIJrtu7HrIAXE3PQK4tlDqg/edit) we can work on for 2017. If you were able to attend, thank you. If we missed you, then there is still a way you can help.<!--more-->

Code for Raleigh has been working with the Wake County IT team to draft a short-list of focus areas and alignment to county initiatives. We want your help to [tell us what&#8217;s important to this community](http://bit.ly/RALWC17) so that we can set our goals for the year. [Take this survey](http://bit.ly/RALWC17) by Wednesday, April 5 and give us your feedback. We&#8217;ve outlined six topic areas including:

  * Affordable housing
  * Open space and parks
  * Hunger, food insecurity, food deserts
  * Transit
  * Business development & diversity
  * Community health

Tell us what&#8217;s important to you and the problems we can help solve for our community.

If you missed the meet-up and want to catch up, be sure to review the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lxOuU2RzNSAZqKu3BRPKAAT6uedtF1tGylkdAcwunXw/present#slide=id.g1d4b5c1100_2_134) we gave and read our [meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DkxZCh6RoDV3Cd0WLRQh_8t9wPm9P2x8QEXQywNqPRg/edit).

## Next steps

After we review the feedback from the survey, we&#8217;ll take that information back to the Wake County CIO, Bill Greeves, and his team to find project champions from county staff. Then we&#8217;ll host another meet-up in April to bring in those experts to help start the dialog for potential projects and start identifying roles you can take in the selected initiatives.

## Save the date

One of the reasons we are prototyping this approach for goal setting and project alignment is to seed ideas for our [NC Open Pass events](http://ncopenpass.com/). Mark your calendars for with these important dates for the fall of 2017 and start to think about the projects you can work on that align with the topic areas listed above.
