Even though your EventBright may indicate the location is the Wake County Commons Building, if you go there, you will be quite lonely until Friday and Saturday. The CityCamp NC action is at HQ Raleigh Thursday night.

Be sure to read more about the [venue](http://citycampnc.org/venue/) and how you can [navigate CityCamp](http://citycampnc.org/2015/06/navigate-citycamp-nc-like-a-pro/) like a pro. Doors open at 5:00pm. If you arrive early, we may put you to work ðŸ˜‰ Hey, we&#8217;re all volunteers here and we&#8217;ve got to set-up like 120 or more chairs.

<a href="http://codeforraleigh.com" target="_blank">Code for Raleigh</a> wants to have a safe and collaborative environment for all participants. Review our [Code of Conduct](http://citycampnc.org/about/code-of-conduct/) before the event. Below you will find the proposed schedule for the evening, subject to change but we hope not too much.

What&#8217;s for dinner you ask? <!--more-->

We have pizza coming from Donatoâ€™s at Seaboard Station.

Where can you park? Street parking is free after 5:00pm. The Warehouse District can be bustling on a Thursday night. Check out our [venue page](http://citycampnc.org/venue/) for tips and tricks on where to park.
