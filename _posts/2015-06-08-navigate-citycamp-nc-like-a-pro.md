The 2015 event is almost here and leading up to it, the planning team wants to make your experience the best it can be. Getting to and from the sites is easy but just to make sure there aren&#8217;t any doubts about transportation or parking, I wanted to go through our locations and how best to arrive.<!--more-->

**HQ Raleigh**

Thursday night&#8217;s kickoff event at HQ Raleigh takes place in the warehouse district of downtown Raleigh.

> [310 S Harrington St Raleigh, NC 27601](https://www.google.com/maps/place/HQ+Raleigh/@35.776684,-78.645406,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89ac5f64915fb76d:0xd1d2e1a0cb4d4dee)

If you are coming from nearby and the weather is nice, walk or ride a bike as HQ Raleigh has bike parking right out in front.

For those driving, there is no official parking lot but nearby streets stop enforcing paid parking at 5pm. Doors open at 5pm for Thursday night&#8217;s event, the same time that on-street parking flips to free.

If you prefer a parking deck for the absolute easiest experience, drive to the Wake County Parking Deck ([216 W Cabarrus St, Raleigh, NC 27601](https://www.google.com/maps/place/216+W+Cabarrus+St,+Raleigh,+NC+27601/@35.7750586,-78.6426245,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89ac5f70e1f68bfd:0xfae613838c30cbb4)) and enter on Cabarrus Street. HQ Raleigh is a two-block walk into the warehouse district. Parking rates are $1 per half-hour.

**Wake County Commons**

The unconference on Friday and Saturday takes place at the Wake County Commons.

> [4011 Carya Dr Raleigh, NC 27610](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wake+County+Commons+Building/@35.771625,-78.570083,715m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89ac5e833487a9ad:0xcc836846a7a6acdf!6m1!1e1)

We&#8217;ll have signs out there to help you navigate but after you turn on to Carya Drive, take the second right to stay on Carya Drive towards the Commons. General Parking is on the right while handicap and the building entrance are on the left.
