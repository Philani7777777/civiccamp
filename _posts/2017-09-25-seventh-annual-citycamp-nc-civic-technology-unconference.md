###  2017 NC Open Pass to focus on open data and economic development

**<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2076" src="http://citycampnc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/logocitycamp.png" alt="" width="216" height="281" data-id="2076" />RALEIGH, NC:** Now in its seventh year, CityCamp NC, part of [NC Open Pass](http://ncopenpass.com), is proof that the civic tech and open government scene in the Triangle is alive and vibrant. CityCamp NC is an annual civic tech event that brings citizens, government change agents, and businesses together to openly innovate and improve our communities. The event begins Thursday evening at 5:30, September 28 with the first ever, mega lighting talk and continues with 5-minute lightning talks and networking opportunities.  Friday, September 29, brings keynote speakers, a public-private sector Smart Cities panel discussion, and unconference sessions&#8211;where participants create the agenda. Saturday, September 30, brings CityCamp NC to a close with the Code for NC hackathon and code sprint, while kicking off NC DataPalooza open data competition. For more information and to register, go to <http://citycampnc.org/register/>.

Jason Hibbets, CityCamp NC co-chair, is excited about the focus on open data and economic development. “Our keynote topic this year will focus on how open data is having a positive impact on economic development with case studies from across the United States with Stephen Larrick from the Sunlight Foundation in his keynote, _Participatory urbanism: from built environment to open data_,” said Hibbets. “I’m also excited about our continued partnership with NC DataPalooza and our hackathon event will be the start of the open data competition that will conclude in November with three teams competing for cash prizes.”

New this year, the NC Open Pass planning team worked with the Wake County Innovation Team starting in February 2017 to identify several projects that could leverage the NC Open Pass events to foster citizen engagement and participation. The three initiatives are:

  * **Parks and Rec park finder** – an app to find all the parks and greenways across the Triangle, including programs and amenities in all municipalities
  * **Not just a flu-shot finder** – an app to where you can search for where to get flu shots and expanding the capabilities to include other health-related needs such as finding narcan and prescription drop-off locations
  * **Business development diversity accelerator** – looking at ways to help minority and under-represented people turn their business ideas into actual businesses by providing resources to streamline the business-creation process

Teams competing in the open data competition are eligible for a $1,000 cash prize during the NC DataPalooza kickoff on September 30 and a $5,000 cash prize on November 13 at the NC DataPalooza finale.

### 7 years of civic tech in the Triangle

The civic tech and open government scene in the Triangle is alive and vibrant. The intersection of citizens, elected officials, and civil servants collaborating on solutions to solve community problems is creating a high level of engagement. This engagement is creating new opportunities and having a positive impact for the entire community (and beyond). But how did all this open government acceleration begin and why are people so interested in getting involved? [Let’s take a look back](https://www.exitevent.com/2017/09/7-years-of-civic-tech-in-the-triangle/) at how an unconference called CityCamp NC came to Raleigh, NC.

### CityCamp NC, what is it? Do I need bug spray and a canteen?

Nope. CityCamp NC is an annual civic tech event that brings citizens, government change agents, and businesses together to openly innovate and improve our communities. Held September 28-30, CityCamp NC aims to re-imagine the way the web, applications, technology, and participation can shape the future of NC cities. CityCamp NC brings together government, business, neighborhood, non-profit, and academic communities to work toward next generation solutions for local municipalities. Even better, you don’t need to be technical to participate. CityCamp NC is renowned for its friendly, open personality that welcomes all participants to help create solutions. In fact, the purpose of any CityCamp program is to highlight the power of participation.

NC DataPalooza and CityCamp NC are continuing their partnership. The NC DataPalooza open data competition kickoff event will coincide with the CityCamp NC hackathon and code sprint. Teams emerging from the open data competition will have a chance pitch their NC DataPalooza project at All Things Open before the NC DataPalooza finale in November.

#### **Participatory Urbanism, say what?**

Keynote speaker and Open Cities Director for the Sunlight Foundation, Stephen Larrick, coined that term to emphasize his view that, “…city making is collaborative.” Stephen’s current efforts focus on facilitating the adoption and implementation of meaningful, sustainable open data policies in dozens of American cities participating in the What Works Cities initiative, with a specific focus on helping to connect city open data efforts to resident empowerment and community impact. Stephen’s talk is highly anticipated as a springboard for a vibrant CityCamp NC and NC DataPalooza gathering. For more on Stephen Larrick, check out this [keynote announcement post](http://citycampnc.org/2017/08/30/the-secrets-to-urbanism-and-open-data/).

#### Lightning Talks, are they dangerous?

Not in the least! Lightning talks are a quick, 5 minute introduction to a single thought or topic. In our case, mostly about civic-tech engagement, with some creative, thought-provoking twists that may surprise you. Throw in free food and drink and one of Raleigh’s hottest new venues, and you are in for a special evening. Join 9 speakers on Thursday, September 28, at 5:30pm in the Cannon Room of [HQ Raleigh&#8217;s](http://hq.community/find-a-location/hq-raleigh/) newest venue and get ready to be inspired. For a complete list of speakers, check out the [speakers](http://citycampnc.org/speakers/) tab on the CityCamp NC website.

#### History of CityCamp

[CityCamp](http://citycamp.com/) was founded by [Kevin Curry](https://twitter.com/kmcurry) and [Jen Pahlka](https://twitter.com/pahlkadot), and the first CityCamp was held in Chicago on January 23-24, 2010. Afterwards, in an effort to inspire cities around the world to start their own CityCamp, the brand was [opened for re-use by anyone](http://opensource.com/government/11/5/how-citycamp-became-open-source-brand). (Source: [CityCamp Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AWfTSB1MMbWCdgzuESQF4izY8vKBxRAC_Afch-8uRCQ/edit#)) CityCamp NC was founded in 2011 and has been growing in popularity ever since.
