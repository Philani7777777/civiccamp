The winning idea for CityCamp Raleigh 2012 started with a 60 second pitch by Lorena Akin and ended (two days later) with a working prototype for a mobile app created by six individuals passionate about the city’s greenway system and using technology to make the experience more interactive. RGreenway’s team members embarked CityCamp as strangers and ended up as collaborators, friends and grand prizewinners.

Since CityCamp, RGreenway has launched the free mobile app, which uses open data from the City of Raleigh, and is now available for both iPhones and Android devices. The core development team consists of Akin, David Matthews, Eric Majewicz, Brad Johnson, Patrick Gravinese and Traci Tillis.

The team continues to meet regularly and implements usability and suggested improvements from the public. To date has had 7,000 downloads of the iPhone version and 650 downloads of the Android version, and the response from app users has been overwhelmingly positive. The team is planning a 2.0 release of the app in the near future.
