We only had four people at our meetup tonight, as there were a few other things happening that people made commitments to. We have 45 days until the event and have a lot of work to get done. We are going to need people to step-up and help make this event successful for Raleigh. Are you ready for the challenge?

Our most urgent need is to line up speakers. It&#8217;s going to be difficult to get sponsors without having a decent speaker line-up. We need to designate a speaking coordinator (who would lead the speaking comittee) by Wednesday of this week. The speaking coordinator would help coordinate getting speakers committed. Our planning group will need to use our entire network to get speakers to commit to Friday, June 3.<!--more-->

I&#8217;m going to start working on a one-pager that we could use to help secure speakers. We need to look professional and organized. The one-pager will include event information, examples from other cities, and success stories from other CityCamps.

We are confident that we have secured a location for Friday and Saturday: Vintage 21. I have a call on Tuesday to try and secure space for Sunday&#8217;s workshops. We are currently planning on 100-300 attendee&#8217;s for the event.

We also discussed logo and identity. There are several things that we think should be included in our branding:

  * name: CityCamp Raleigh
  * passion / activism
  * technology
  * community
  * government
  * problem solving
  * empowerment
  * _not_ camping

Finally, Hilary presented a nice vision for what Friday should look like. Our current thinking is that Friday is the most formal, planned part of the event. We think our speakers on Friday should present why open government is important and inspire the attendees for the weekend. Then, the speakers should talk about how open government happens with a focus on technology. We should conclude Friday with local expertise, highlighting what Raleigh already has and provide examples from other CityCamps.

The biggest impact we can have for the Friday session is to leave the attendees with how they can make a difference. Give them some nuggets on what they can do make change happen. We also want to inspirce them to attend and participate on Saturday and Sunday.
