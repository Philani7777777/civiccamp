One of the highlights of the evening was conducting a demo of the <a title="Adopta-a-shelter app" href="http://adoptashelter.raleighnc.gov/" target="_blank">Adopta-a-shelter app</a>. The main highlight was the challenge issued by Councilor Crowder to Councilor Gaylord.<!--more-->

The council was very enthusiastic about the app. The public challenge between Councilors Crowder and Gaylord is to get at least four new adoptions by the end of the week in their respective districts. At-large Councilor Baldwin also agreed to adopt a new bus shelter not visible in the app yet that is in her neighborhood. Jokingly, Councilor Crowder claimed Councilor Baldwin for his team.

The presentation <a title="we gave is available on Google Drive" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WjXVfNAtgFeKDoBo88im3UMWpMTTSUkgAnYK2NcMy1g/edit" target="_blank">we gave is available on Google Drive</a>. We&#8217;ve made it publicly available for others to see, but really, for other Code for America brigade teams to use as a resource.

Our strategy was to make sure the council was familiar with Code for America, the brigade program, and the Race for Reuse campaign. We kept it very high level, used analogies, such as Code for America is like Teaching for America, but for local municipalities. Then we went into details about our goals, did a demo of the app, and **most** **importantly**, we publicly thanked city staff that helped. This was very important to do.

We also showed city council where we were at in the campaign, 6 new bus shelter adoptions, and then took questions. During Q&A, things got exciting. Councilors wanted to explore the app, had questions about new bus shelters, and were very appreciative. We have three days to adopt 14 shelters. And from what we can tell, our City Council is amped to help us meet our goal.

## Video of the presentation

We were first on the agenda so it should be right at the beginning of the following video or embedded above:

## Civic-a-thon

<a href="http://citycampral.org/2012/12/council-challenge-issued-for-bus-shelter-adoption/adopta_dla/" rel="attachment wp-att-920"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-920" title="adopta_dla" src="http://citycampral.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/adopta_dla-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Saturday&#8217;s Civic-a-thon drew about 15 people. We had developers, citizens, and a Digital Connector. Our focus was on enhancing the adopta app to be more efficient with the Raleigh bus shelter adoption program. They currently have a PDF form that needs to be completed and we would like that process to occur all within the app. We spent a lot of time whiteboarding and mapping out existing variables to form variables.

Before the civic-a-thon ended, we gathered at Raleigh bus shelter R9 to unveil the newly installed decal for the Raleigh Downtown Living Advocates&#8211;one of the first volunteer groups to adopt a shelter under the existing program.

There are many more bus shelters that could be adopted. Are you willing to adopt one?
