#### What is an Unconference?

An unconference is a participant-driven conference where you, the participant, set the agenda for the unconference at the beginning of the day. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion can pitch a topic and the group votes on which topics will get time and space during the event. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The event includes open sourced talks, workshops, and hands-on problem solving to re-imagine the way the web, applications, technology, and participation will shape the future of NC cities. </span>

In addition to the location, we&#8217;re also excited to announce a slight shift in our Saturday hackathon competition. This year we will be co-located with NC DataJam during our Saturday code sprint which mean <span style="font-weight: 400;">CityCampers will also be able to participate in the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">NC Datapalooza</span>](http://www.ncdatapalooza.com/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">competition kickoff. Teams will develop their ideas into reality during this code sprint and begin prototyping for the competition. Presentations from the code sprint and judging for NCDataJam will be held on Saturday afternoon.</span>

Lastly, and yes of course we save the very best for last, we have some great speakers heading up much of our CityCamp NC 2016 lineup. The final list isn&#8217;t set yet but to help give you an idea of who to expect before the unconference portion of the program, we&#8217;ve highlighted a few here:

  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">Public CIO Panel who will include representatives from Wake County, Raleigh, Greensboro</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy Gaskins, Panopticon Global, formerly of MetLife and NOAA</span>
