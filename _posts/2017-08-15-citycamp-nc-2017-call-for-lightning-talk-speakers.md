The organizers are creating a great line-up of speakers to share their stories. We’d like to open up our call for speakers to join our inspirational kick off event on the evening of Thursday, September 28 at the HQ Capital Club. Are you the next addition to our speaker line-up? Do you know someone who has a great story to share or can present a challenge we can solve for our community?<span id="more-1421"></span>

Here’s the deal. Speakers get five minutes on stage to share a story or challenge. they can have slides if they want to. We’re not very picky. But talks must be about something open source, open government, open data, or civic engagement.

Our call for speakers will be open until Monday, August 28—so get your talks submitted!
