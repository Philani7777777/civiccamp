  - Building CityCamp Raleigh
---
On Sunday 3/27, we met at [Helios](http://cafehelios.com) for another planning/idea session. Some of the topics we covered were:

  * elevator speech / how to communicate what CityCamp is
  * partners / stakeholders
  * sponsors / funding
  * potential speakers and topics
  * logistics

We spent a lot of time discussing how we should describe CityCamp. It&#8217;s a complex idea that we&#8217;re struggling with defining even for ourselves. Bonner brought a well-thought-out &#8216;elevator speech&#8217; that serves as a great starting point, but we recognized the need to create an evenÂ briefer version.

Jason has graciously stepped up to project-manage the team. His experience in building [open source communities](http://opensource.com/) is going to be really helpful.

We scheduled [the next meeting](http://www.meetup.com/GovLoop/Raleigh-NC/87215/) for Sunday April 3rd.
