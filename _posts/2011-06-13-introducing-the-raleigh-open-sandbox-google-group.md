My team during CityCamp Raleigh discussed the city&#8217;s current methods of passing along ride information through various technological means. The problem we identified was the lack of information a rider gets from being at any given bus stop on Raleigh&#8217;s Capital Area Transit (CAT) system. The signs indicate the route served and offers a number to call for more information. From our experience, calling this number was slow and unresponsive. (we were on hold for quite a few minutes when we called)

At the same time, [Triangle Transit has opened up their data](http://www.gotriangle.org/developers) on bus routes, bus stops and schedules on their website. This includes all the services under their umbrella, which CAT is a part of. [RaleighRides.org](http://www.raleighrides.org/) currently shows you where every CAT bus currently running is with an estimated time until arriving at major bus stops. Unfortunately, this application is web only and no mobile application exists at the moment.

So we saw a major disconnect between the available data and the actual users that stand out at the bus stops. There are some stops on the CAT system that have live information screens but being able to count them with your fingers means there&#8217;s still a lot of work to do on a network of about 1500 total stops. How could we bring route information to users and implement the system cheaply?

Since the data is open and the live GPS feeds are being gathered today, the best solution was to use a rider&#8217;s cell phone as the link between that data and the user. 96% of Americans own a cell phone so our ideas here help our the vast majority. I&#8217;ll break up each idea into sections and explain how each will inform the rider of when the bus will arrive and any other related info.

**Bus Stop Identifiers**

One important thing to our ideas is the concept of specific bus stop information. In order to do this, each one would need to have a unique identifier in order for the correct data to be given to the rider. We would implement a numbering scheme across the entire network so each bus stop can be found if a user passed along the stop&#8217;s unique name.

**Phone Number with Automated voice**

The phone number that is currently being used will need an upgrade. Rather than an actual human on the other end, an automated voice system can relay information back to the rider after he/she enters the bus stop unique identifier, written on the sign at the stop. The automated voice can then list off the number of minutes for the arrival of the next bus. If a stop is served by more than one bus, then the automated voice can also ask for the route number that the rider wishes to hear about.

Once set up, this idea could be accessed by anyone with a cell phone, needs little maintenance, and runs 24/7/365.

**Text Messages**

Some riders may prefer to grab information via text messaging and the CAT phone number should be able to accept them. If a system was in place for the CAT number to accept messages with station identifiers and route numbers in a fairly easy way, it could automatically respond with the number of minutes until the bus arrives.

Additional enhancements could be added like subscribing to alerts or warnings of a bus&#8217;s arrival. For example, &#8220;The next route 17 bus will arrive in 2 minutes.&#8221;

**QR Codes for Bus Stop specific websites**

The most advanced idea here is the idea of creating a website for every single bus stop. These websites would contain information for that specific stop including but not limited to, arrival time of the next buses, upcoming alerts, links to view other route info.

This is the smartphone solution and it uses QR codes to point a rider&#8217;s smartphone to the bus stop&#8217;s website. The smartphone would scan the QR code pasted to the bus sign and the rider would then have information on their device.

&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.

To take these ideas further, our group has created the [Raleigh Open Sandbox Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/raleighsandbox) in order to keep the discussion going and will meet regularly to see if any of these transit related ideas can be made into reality. Our first meeting is:

Wednesday June 15th, 2011 @ 6pm

Cafe Helios
  
413 Glenwood Avenue, Raleigh, NC

Please join the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/raleighsandbox) to see the discussion and help in creating this idea as well as any others that involve open data from the government.
