**How an Army of Techies Is Taking on City Hall**

Check out the following [Fast Company article by Anya Kamenetz](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/151/icitizen-bonus.html) about citizens (and yes, politicians are citizens) engaging in basic community maintenance, and those working to make web and mobile technologies use city data and neighborhood requests for community care-taking.

The article gives a brief overview of the Gov2.0 movement and talks with several previous CityCamp sponsors and attendees like – Code for America, SeeClickFix, and the Sunlight Foundation.
