On <a title="opensource.com" href="http://opensource.com" target="_blank">opensource.com</a>, I wrote a two part series about Open Raleigh. Raleigh is on the fast-track to being the world&#8217;s first open source city—and CityCamp is a major  catalyst for the open government movement here in Raleigh. Don&#8217;t forget to join us for the <a title="Innovate Raleigh meetup on July 18" href="http://innovateraleighcitycamp.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">Innovate Raleigh meetup on July 18</a>.<!--more-->

Open government scored another victory when the City of Raleigh announced the Open Raleigh initiative—an online repository with open data, web and mobile applications, and links to participatory tools and organizations. It’s all part of Raleigh’s open source strategy focusing on transparency, collaboration, and improved access to information. It’s proof of the ongoing work of the public-facing, open source resolution Raleigh unanimously passed earlier this year.

As part of the Open Raleigh announcement, the city included an online feedback system: My Raleigh Ideas! It’s a new service the city will use to collaborate with the public to solicit ideas on future projects and topics. Currently, the city is using it to prioritize the data citizens might want in the open data portal and to solicit input for the open data policy.

You can’t get much more open source than collaboratively creating your open data policy with citizens and other stakeholders.

## <a title="An open source city takes shape: The impact of Open Raleigh" href="https://opensource.com/government/12/7/open-source-city-takes-shape-impact-open-raleigh" target="_blank">An open source city takes shape: The impact of Open Raleigh</a>

In part one of this series, we talked about open government scoring another victory with the City of Raleigh&#8217;s Open Raleigh initiative. We reviewed the technological components of the open data portal, including ESRI, Granicus, GovDelivery, and SeeClickFix. It&#8217;s pretty clear that these tools and ways of thinking are having an impact on Raleigh governance.  But what about the other way around?  Is the open government initiative taking place contagious?  We hope so.
