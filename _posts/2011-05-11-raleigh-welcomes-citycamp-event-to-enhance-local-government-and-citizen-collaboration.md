**Citizen-led “unconference” brings innovation and cooperation to the capital city June 3, 4, and 5, 2011.**

Raleigh, NC, May 11, 2011:  CityCamp Raleigh today announced the first city-focused “unconference” in North Carolina that brings together government, business, neighborhood, non-profit, and academic communities working toward next generation solutions for Raleigh. In a world challenged to do more with less, the City of Raleigh is <a href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=6c3d9&t=6c3d9.40&f=6c3d9.29534c" target="_blank">open to ideas</a> from citizens and technology professionals (web developers, programmers, and app developers) on how to streamline procedures, share information and create innovative solutions using the latest technology.  According to Mayor Charles Meeker, “our citizens are ready for Raleigh to move forward and be more open sourced focused. The technology is successful. Raleigh is ready to be the worldwide hub for open source.”

The event is free to the public and will kick off Friday, June 3rd at 12.30pm at Vintage 21 downtown Raleigh, S. West Street, and continues Saturday and Sunday, June 4 &#8211; 5, 2011.  “The City of Raleigh has a long and successful history of citizen participation and engagement,” said City Manager Russell Allen.  “The possibility of using technology and software applications as new methods of achieving transparency and interaction is a very exciting opportunity.  Strong cities find ways to connect creativity for the benefit of productive outcomes.”  Other confirmed speakers at this time include, Michael Tiemann, VP of Open Source Affairs at Red Hat, Inc., as well as president of the Open Source Initiative, and Jimmy Goodmon, VP/GM, Capital Broadcasting New Media Company.

As an “unconference”, content for CityCamp is created and organized by participants and coordinated by facilitators.  Participant’s play an active role in the event formatted for creative, open exchange geared toward action. “The goal of CityCamp Raleigh is to collaboratively generate ideas on how to apply technology to government problems to create better, more efficient services for citizens. We want to re-imagine the way the web, applications, technology, and participation will shape the future of our city,” said Jason Hibbets, the planning committee co-chair.

CityCamp Raleigh participants have the chance to provide input and share experiences on crime, trash, water/sewer, property taxes, streets (pot holes, curbs), storm water management, parks and recreation, transit, and other issues.  Public engagement enhances the government’s effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions.  All citizens are invited to participate either before or after the conference by <a href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=6c3d9&t=6c3d9.40&f=6c3d9.29534c" target="_blank">posting suggestions and ideas</a> on the CityCampRal.org website under ‘Get Started’.
