Our organizers are creating a great line-up of speakers to share their stories. So far, we&#8217;ve confirmed Twyla McDermott (Charlotte Open Data Portal Manager), Caroline Sullivan (Wake County Commissioner), Kim Johnson (Wake County Employer Outreach Coordinator, Go Triangle), Sarah Kahn (Girl Develop It), Lisa Abeyta (AppCityLife), and Mark Headd (Technical Evangelist at Accela). We&#8217;d like to add a few more speakers to our line-up to create an inspirational kick off event on the evening of Thursday, June 11. Are you our next addition to the speaker line-up?<!--more-->

Here&#8217;s the deal. You get five minutes on stage to share your story. You can have slides. If you want them to auto-advance, that&#8217;s your call. We&#8217;re not picky. But your talk must be about something open source, open government, open data, or civic engagement. Our call for speakers <del>will be open until Tuesday, May 19</del>. has been extended until Friday, May 22—so get your talks submitted!
