The organizers are creating a great line-up of speakers to share their stories. We’d like to open up our call for speakers to join our inspirational kick off event on the evening of Thursday, September 22. Are you our next addition to the speaker line-up? Do you know someone who has a great story to share or a challenge we can solve for our community?<span id="more-1421"></span>

Here’s the deal. You get five minutes on stage to share your story or challenge. You can have slides if you want them. We’re not picky. But your talk must be about something open source, open government, open data, or civic engagement. Our call for speakers will be open until Wednesday, August 24.—so get your talks submitted!
