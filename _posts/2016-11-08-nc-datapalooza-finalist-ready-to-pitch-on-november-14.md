The 4th annual NC Datapalooza finale is happening next week! 8 teams made pitches to a panel of judges at the All Thing Open conference on October 27 and three teams advanced to the finale and demo day. On Monday, November 14, North Carolina’s premier open data competition for 2016 will come to an end when the three remaining teams will give their final presentations to win the grand prize of $5,000. In addition to the pitch competition, attendees will hear from leaders in open data, government, and technology.

## Details

  * NC Datapalooza Finale
  * November 14, 2016, 5:00-8:00 pm
  * Red Hat Annex, 190 East Davie Street, Raleigh, NC 27601
  * More information: [ncdatapalooza.com](http://www.ncdatapalooza.com/)

The teams are judged on criteria that include impact of the project, scalability, the progress and execution for creating an minimum viable product (MVP), the user experience, and of course, the use of open data.

Of the teams that presented at All Things Open, these three will be competing for the final prizes:

  * **OverEasy** —OverEasy is solving the problem of access for anyone who stands to benefit from open geospatial data.  The user makes just two decisions and they receive a beautiful, useful and printable report. The software is web-based and can sit on top of the many open data sources and APIs currently published on the web.
  * **NC Food Inspector** —The team assembled at National Day of Civic Hacking and NC CityCamp / NC DataPalooza events with the purpose of extending the use of open restaurant inspection and violation data from Wake County.  Building off of the success of the existing Code for Durham application, NC Food Inspector, the team will add CDC Food Borne Illness Risk Factor data to the existing violations data.  The team is a mix of front end and back end developers, designers, project management, and interested citizens.
  * **New Cartographers** —Building off a project presented at CityCamp NC, Kids Transit enables students and parents to identify safe routes to school, organize ad-hoc walking or biking groups, improve community involvement, identify barriers to pedestrian and cycling mobility, and helps school systems reduce bus use to improve the air quality of schools.

Refreshments will be provided to attendees. [Registration](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/nc-datapalooza-2016-tickets-28087595755) is required.
