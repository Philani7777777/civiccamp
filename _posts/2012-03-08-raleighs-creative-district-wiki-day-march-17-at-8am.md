Neighborhood leaders from the <a title="Creative District" href="https://trianglewiki.org/creative_district" target="_blank">Creative District</a> are looking to document the history, assets, and knowledge of Southwest Raleigh on the morning of March 17. We are planning a content day to add pages and knowledge to <a title="trianglewiki.org" href="http://trianglewiki.org/" target="_blank">trianglewiki.org</a>.

Attendees will get a brief overview of how to create a new wiki page, how to use the mapping application, how to link to other wiki pages, and how to edit existing pages.

Our goal will be to document as many neighborhoods, places, and unique features that exist in the Creative District.<!--more-->

Get pumped up before this event and join the <a title="Triangle Wiki Launch party" href="https://trianglewiki.org/Triangle_Wiki_Launch" target="_blank">Triangle Wiki Launch party</a> on March 14 at Bu-Ku. Learn what the project is all about next Wednesday, then join us on Saturday, March 17 for an edit party focused on the Creative District.

  * Ideas, knowledge, and a keen interest in building a great community website

## Volunteering

We are looking for volunteers to pair up with citizens who do not have laptops, but have knowledge of the area. Volunteers would work with people who have stockpiles of information about the Creative District, but may lack some of the tech-saavy skills to create their own wiki page. High school students, college students (hint, hint communications and journalism majors), and anyone else interested should attend. We will sign any paper work needed for you to get credit for volunteer hours.

_This event is brought to you by CityCamp Raleigh—the Triangle Wiki initiative is another example of how using open source and collaboration is defining the City of Raleigh as a city of innovation and maintaining the Research Triangle as a leading technology region. Join up with like-minded individuals and feed off the energy in the room as we produce hundreds of pages of content._
