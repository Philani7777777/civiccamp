In partnership with the [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/), this year’s CityCamp NC has free admission for those of you that can only attend on Saturday, May 31.  Join other area civic hackers in helping to make your city a better place to live.  Starting at 9:00 am, you will be introduced to civic hacking 101 and brought up-to-speed on the CityCamp format for ideas.  Here are five reasons you should come to William Peace University on Saturday to experience National Day of Civic Hacking:<!--more-->

1. It’s free!  [Register now.](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/citycamp-nc-2014-tickets-11441496825)

2. Opportunity to join an existing CityCamp NC build team:  If the existing CityCamp NC teams are in need of a developer, then you are welcome to join in and help them build a prototype and/or presentation on the goodness that they are creating.  We can match you up if you are interested in one of their projects.

3. Meet smart, like-minded folks:  CityCamp NC is one of the few events each year focused around civic innovation where you can meet all types of people and work together on a common goal.

4. Hack away: There will be guest access computers available in a computer lab, but feel free to bring your laptop.  Mere mortals are welcome.  All levels of skill will be present, from entrepreneurial types, policy wonks, civic geeks, noob coders, and [craftsman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship).  Here are just a few quick ideas that you can hack on, but no official agenda has been set.

  * Google Fiber sign up page &#8211; create a fiber education website that let’s people sign up who are interested in getting fiber to their home or business.  Display those who have signed up on a map.
  * Hack on Mixare an open source augmented reality engine so that it can be ported to Google Glass.  (There is a rumour that you will be able to test out Google Glasses at the event).
  * Extend the RGreenway mobile app to include more greenway trails and cities.
  * Work on a Triangle Quality of Life Dashboard.
  * Brainstorm and build projects around ‘gig apps’.  Apps that can leverage ludicrous speed aka fiber.
  * Learn how to create a simple yet powerful mapping web application in leaflet.js in less than [20 lines of code](http://50.116.33.197/chadfoley/map5.html).
  * Learn how to mobilize your html/css/javascript using Phonegap/Apache Cordova.
  * Insert your idea here&#8230;

5. Watch the CityCamp NC team presentations at 4:00 pm.  If you have never attended a CityCamp, then you are in for a treat.  You can also watch the 2014 [Multi-City Innovation Campaign](http://2014cityinnovation.populr.me/home) finalists at 1:00pm via Google Hangouts.

So do something fun this Saturday and stop by CityCamp NC to experience the National Day of Civic Hacking—you will be glad that you did.
