#### What is CityCamp NC?

CityCamp NC, part of [NC Open Pass](http://citycampnc.org/2017/08/14/get-your-2017-nc-open-pass/), is a three day event that bring citizens, government, and businesses together to openly innovate on next generation solutions for communities. CityCamp NC&#8217;s mission seeks to provide a space for the exchange of ideas across a broad spectrum of community leaders, citizens, and technologists by encouraging peer-to-peer learning, collaboration, and creative engagement.

#### What is an Unconference?

An unconference is a participant-driven conference where you, the participant, set the agenda for the unconference at the beginning of the day. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion can pitch a topic and the group votes on which topics will get time and space during the event. The event includes open sourced talks, workshops, and hands-on problem solving to re-imagine the way the web, applications, technology, and participation will shape the future of our state.

If you participated in any of the past CityCamp NC&#8217;s events you know the great sessions, discussions, and outcomes that come from these three days. This year will not be any different, but we do have a few changes that we&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ll be excited about.

First, CityCamp NC 2017 will take place in downtown Raleigh at the new Cannon Room @ HQ Raleigh space and we will return to Nash Hall, a gathering space focused on helping create positive community changes. From the opening event on Thursday evening at HQ Raleigh&#8217;s Cannon Room to the final hours of the open data competition kickoff on Saturday, we&#8217;ll be gathering together in great spaces that foster collaboration. The event will start with a kickoff on Thursday evening, September 28th, including opening remarks, a round of lightning talks, and networking.

Second, we have three teams already forming from Wake County that are looking to foster citizen engagement, feedback, and participation. The [three projects were prepared in partnership with Wake County](http://citycampnc.org/2017/03/30/code-for-raleigh-partners-with-wake-county-for-projects/) and we can&#8217;t wait for you to join one of them:

  * **Parks and Rec park finder** – an app to find all the parks and greenways across the Triangle, including programs and amenities in all municipalities
  * **Not just a flu-shot finder** – an app to where you can search for where to get flu shots and expanding the capabilities to include other health-related needs such as finding narcan and prescription drop-off locations
  * **Business development diversity accelerator** – looking at ways to help minority and under-represented people turn their business ideas into actual businesses by providing resources to streamline the business-creation process

Lastly, we&#8217;ve got some great speakers confirmed for Friday, September 29th to help inspire us. This includes a public and private sector Smart Cities panel and our keynote speaker, Stephen Larrick, from the Sunlight Foundation. He will be talking about how open data influences economic development. <br class="m_-588643476574657577gmail-m_-6294201672388834430gmail-kix-line-break" />
