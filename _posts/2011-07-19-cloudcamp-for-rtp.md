Attention CityCampers in Raleigh and the Triangle, we&#8217;d like to let you know about an upcoming camp that is focused on the cloud. The organizers of <a title="CloudCamp Carrboro" href="http://www.cloudcamp.org/rtp" target="_blank">CloudCamp Carrboro</a> sent us the following information about their event. We thought it would be nice to pass it along:

> Any participants in the recent CityCamp Raleigh are cordially invited to lend a hand for the next fun &#8220;Camp-style&#8221; event in the neighborhood: CloudCamp Carrboro.
> 
> We are organizing this event via weekly meetings at the Panera Bread at Southpoint Mall. Come by at 5:30pm any Wednesday between now and August 6 to share tips and ideas about how we can make a great camp!
> 
> We would love to hear from you.
> 
> Thanks,
  
> Robert, Allen, Brian and Valdez
