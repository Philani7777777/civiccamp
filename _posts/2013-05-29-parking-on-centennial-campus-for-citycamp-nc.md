We know you&#8217;re anxious to get to CityCamp NC and some of you have asked about parking. We sent an email out earlier today to everyone who pre-registered. But if you haven&#8217;t registered yet, walk-ups are welcome. We&#8217;ll have a laptop on hand to complete your payment and registration. Now, where should you park?<!--more-->

The event is at the Hunt Library, located on <a title="NC State’s Centennial Campus" href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/parking" target="_blank">NC State’s Centennial Campus</a>. While there will look like there are plenty of places to park, it’s a campus and many lots and decks are permit only. Luckily, we&#8217;re in the first summer session, so both vehicle and foot traffic is lower this time of year.

We have 200 FREE reserved spots in the <a title="Red Hat deck" href="http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/trans/maps/images/12-13_allCampusMap.jpg" target="_blank">Red Hat deck</a>, which is only a 5 minute walk from the library. CityCampers are asked to park on the third and fourth levels of the parking deck. We recommend bookmarking the campus map page so you’ll know where you’re going, but we’ll have some signage out to direct you once you get to campus. Thank you Red Hat for helping us with parking.

There is also a PAID parking area, the <a title="CRC Deck" href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=217795341461784470618.0004d57452c7f092639f7&msa=0.%20" target="_blank">CRC Deck</a>, for anyone who needs to be as close as possible.  Fees are $2/hr with a maximum of $10 charged.

Transit options include the Wolfline which would get to the library. See the schedule at  <a title="http://ncsu.transloc.com" href="http://ncsu.transloc.com/" target="_blank">http://ncsu.transloc.com</a>
