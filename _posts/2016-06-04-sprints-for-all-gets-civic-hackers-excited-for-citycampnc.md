More than 50 civic hackers attended the &#8220;[Sprints for All](http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Code-for-America/events/230559331/)&#8221; event organized by Code for Durham one June 4. There were five projects that attendees gathered around and made progress on during the sprint. Two projects were prepared in advance and facilitated by the organizers (School Navigator and Citygram) while the other three projects wear pitched at the event.

Nationally, there were over 100 civic hacking events across the US according to a [tweet from the USCTO](https://twitter.com/USCTO/status/739134470482059265), Megan Smith. One of those happened to be hosted by the [Caktus Group](https://www.caktusgroup.com/) in downtown Durham for the [Triangle Code for America Brigades](http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Code-for-America/): Code for Durham, Code for Cary, and Code for Raleigh. Let&#8217;s take a look at the projects and some of the results.

  1. **School Navigator** &#8211; This team is launching School Profiles (v2) for this website. Participants helped to onboard new contributors to the project, some got up to speed on style sheets, improved the design of the school profile page with a few mock-ups, and looked at adding a Google Analytics plugin. Project <a href="http://codefordurham.com/projects/school_navigator" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=http://codefordurham.com/projects/school_navigator&source=gmail&ust=1465134302891000&usg=AFQjCNEvMtxZD0Q8TWl_5XCG5SFU7muxWA">info and task list</a>.

  2. **Citygram** &#8211; This application sends alerts/digests for crime, development activity, and other timely data. Participants did a paper re-design of a weekly digest email, how to get a volunteer feed integrated, and developing a special event closure use case. Project <a href="http://codefordurham.com/projects/citygram-redeploy" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=http://codefordurham.com/projects/citygram-redeploy&source=gmail&ust=1465134302891000&usg=AFQjCNHbn2i6GI04aT7GHVRtafzaGnLSjw">info and task list</a>.
  3. **Durham Properties** &#8211; This team was looking to extend the work from the Triangle Hub and bring in data and assets for Durham. [Results from the sprint.](http://trianglehub.onconcursive.com/show/108-morris-st-durham-nc) This team was able to integrate several data sets from Durham into the Triangle Hub including real estate and crime data.
  4. **NC Food Inspector** &#8211; This team is looking to build on the work from [Durham Food Inspector](https://github.com/codefordurham/Durham-Restaurants). Participants mapped out a new sprint with a updated design for NC Food Inspector and they want to add/incorporate the five major risk factors in the health score.

  5. **End-Hunger Durham** &#8211; A team of people were working on mapping food pantry information. They got data entered and pushed it out to their [website](http://www.endhungerdurham.org/).

### Visit from The Whitehouse

<img class="size-medium wp-image-1852 alignleft" src="http://citycampnc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ndoch_rossdakin-300x200.jpg" alt="ndoch_rossdakin" width="300" height="200" />The event was excited to host [Ross Dakin](http://rossdakin), a Presidential Innovation Fellow who came to Durham just to see this event. He said a few words and told us about the [Opportunity Projects](http://opportunity.census.gov/) from the Census Bureau. Dakin then participated in several of the project happening throughout the day and shared some reflections after we wrapped-up with project readouts and reports.

### How to stay involved

Many of these project will continue their work during meet-ups hosted by the various Code for Triangle Brigades. Check the [meet-up page](http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Code-for-America/) to see when the next civic hacking night will be in Cary, Durham, and Raleigh.

The next big code sprint and gathering of the brigades will happen at CityCamp NC on September 22-24. Co-located with CityCamp NC this year is the NC Datapalooza open data competition kickoff. Some of the teams are planning to take their work from _Sprints for All_ to CityCamp NC, then compete in NC Datapalooza competition.

For those of you interested in attending both CityCamp NC and NC Datapalooza, be sure to save by purchasing your [NC Open Pass](http://ncopenpass.com/).
