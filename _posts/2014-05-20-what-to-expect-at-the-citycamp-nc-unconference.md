An unconference can be a little chaotic to someone who has never been to one before, but believe me, it will make sense after you go through the experience. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the format or what will happen, this blog post will walk you through what you can expect from CityCamp NC.

## What is an unconference?

Let&#8217;s start with the basics. An unconference flips a normal &#8220;conference&#8221; or trade show a little on it&#8217;s head. Organizers plan the logistics just like any other event: location, food, parking, registration, marketing, etc. The only thing organizers don&#8217;t plan<!--more--> is the agenda. At an unconference, the agenda is created by the participants who come with ideas, challenges, or some expertise they want to share. After some type of voting process, organizers create the agenda based on the top voted ideas.

The agenda can be very low tech. It can range from a whiteboard style &#8220;grid&#8221; to construction paper and tape. The &#8220;grid&#8221; will usually have room numbers/locations on one axis and time slots on the other. The session topics are then filled-in with the most popular topics getting the larger rooms and similar topics getting merged together.

## Doing a CityCamp NC pitch

On Friday, May 30 at William Peace University, pitches will start at 9:15 am. Organizers will provide a sheet of paper to write down your session topic and name, then participants will have 60 seconds to pitch their idea. Anyone doing a pitch will line-up on one side of the auditorium and the pitches will be very free-flowing. This process will usually take us anywhere from 30-45 minutes depending on the number of pitches/session topics.

We encourage anyone to <a title="pitch an idea" href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=21747e&t=21747e.40" target="_blank">pitch an idea</a>, a challenge, or something they&#8217;d like to share. Here are few examples of session topics:

  * Code for NC community &#8211; this session will share the plan to deploy a communications infrastructure for civic hackers across NC and prepare you to work on the project during the hackathon on Saturday
  * TriangleWiki &#8211; come learn about the LocalWiki project and how we&#8217;re creating an online community to help edit our cities in the Triangle
  * Open Data policy for the State of NC &#8211; this session is a discussion about how we can get the NC Legislature to pass an open data law for the entire State of NC
  * Open source 101 &#8211; learn about the value that open source can bring to your software projects and the open source development model
  * Find Parking App &#8211; this session would like to explore what building a parking locator application would look like for Charlotte, NC and possibly form a team for the competition

**Got an idea?** Share it on our <a title="Google Moderator forum" href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=21747e&t=21747e.40" target="_blank">Google Moderator forum</a> before the unconference.

## How we vote at CityCamp NC

After the pitches conclude, each attendee will have a chance to vote on their favorite topics/sessions. We&#8217;ll announce the official number of votes during the event, but each participant will get at least three votes. Traditionally, we&#8217;ve placed the paper with session topics and names along the auditorium stage and will use pens/markers to place tick marks on the topics you&#8217;re voting on.

Organizers will tally the votes and create the agenda for the remainder of the day. After voting, participants will have the option to listen to to an _Uncoference 101_ session that will help explain the best way for you to maximize your CityCamp NC experience.

## Attending sessions at CityCamp NC

Once the organizers unveil the conference schedule for the day, also called &#8220;the grid,&#8221; you&#8217;ll get to select which sessions to attend. We will have one session before lunch starting at 10:30 am, then return after lunch with sessions starting at 1:00 pm, 2:00 pm, 3:00 pm, and 4:00 pm. Each session will be 50-minutes long.

We encourage participants to practice the law of two feet, which means that if you attend a session and it&#8217;s not what you expect, you&#8217;re perfectly welcome to quietly leave the session and attend a different session that may be of more interest.

Ideally, each session will have a moderator in the room (if we can get enough volunteers) and we&#8217;d like to document each session on the Triangle Wiki.

## Forming a team at CityCamp NC

Throughout the day, you&#8217;ll attend different sessions. At the end of each session, attendees in the session should consider forming a team around the idea and the discussion that happened. Some sessions will just be informative, other&#8217;s will try to solve problems. Determine if the session you&#8217;re in would be a good candidate for the competition.

Official team forms are due by 5:00 pm on Friday afternoon. Teams will then have the next 24 hours to prototype their project and prepare for presentations on Saturday afternoon.
