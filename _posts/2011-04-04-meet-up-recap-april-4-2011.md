Another great meet-up tonight. We first shared a few updates on what each of us did over the last week to make progress on making CityCamp Raleigh really happen. It was an around-the-horn type session. I&#8217;m not sure we captured every detail&#8211;but we probably should for future meet-ups. <!--more-->

We started talking about the event logistics and how to move foward. We discussed, at-length, a location. We think in order to move forward, we need to identify a location to host the event. The Raleigh Convention Center is our preferred location. We think it needs to be downtown, in an urban setting. The Marriott, Sheraton, and Vintage 21 are other options we want to explore. Here is a list of all the places we mentioned:

  * Convention Center
  * Marriott
  * Sheraton
  * Vintage 21
  * North Hills
  * Lincoln Theatre
  * Meymandi Hall
  * Fletcher Opera Hall
  * NC State, Meredith, Shaw, Peace
  * NCSU Library?
  * McKimmon Center
  * Hotels?

The next steps involve checking: costs, availability (June 3-5), room set-up, and Internet access. We can deal with the food later. We did note that some venues will lock us into their catering options.

We brefily talked about speakers and recognized that we need to figure out who might be able to speak (and what topics). Next week, we may go into more depth about how many &#8220;fixed&#8221; speaking slots we want to have.

Lastly, some people had to leave, but the folks that stuck around agreed that we need to review the website THIS WEEK and get it going. Even if it&#8217;s not ready, we need to get it out there and start generating some buzz and interest in the groups efforts.

Feel free to add any details in the comments that I may have missed.
