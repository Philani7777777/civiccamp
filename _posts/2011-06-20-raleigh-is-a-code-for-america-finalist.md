The City of Raleigh has been named a finalist in [Code for America&#8217;s 2012 national fellowship program](http://codeforamerica.org/2012-city-finalists/ "2012 Code for America City Finalists").

Through a competitive process, Code for America chooses cities with proposals which reflect a deep understanding of the power that technology can bring to cities. In 2011, Code for America hosted inaugural projects in Boston, Philadelphia, and Seattle. For the 2012 program, over 20 governments applied to participate in the program. Raleigh is one of 10 selected as a finalist.<!--more-->

In partnership with the City of Raleigh, Code for America is moving forward with plans to provide an innovative web application that will make City government more efficient, transparent and participatory. To do this, Code for America recruits the talent from the technology industry to give a year of service building innovative web applications for city governments. Code for America is currently seeking tech-savvy individuals to [apply for their fellowship](http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/ "Code for America Fellows") to build this technology for Raleigh.

A Code for America program at the City of Raleigh would take the momentum that has been created by CityCamp Raleigh and take it up a notch. Â Code for America fellows could accelerate the building of some of the solutions that were dreamed up during CityCamp and could further the government/citizen/industry community here in Raleigh.

The City of Raleigh is looking for funding support from local foundations, companies and others to bring Code for America to the Capital City.
