Whether its your first time attending CityCamp NC or your sixth–or somewhere in between–we&#8217;re excited to bring back one of the most popular parts of our civic innovation-focused event: [**CityCamp NC Lightning Talks**](http://citycampnc.org/speakers/). The lightning talks will offer us inspiration, insights, and share lots of information in a short amount of time. Each speaker will get five minutes, yes, only _five_ minutes to share their topic. Not only will this be the fastest hour at CityCamp NC, it&#8217;s our chance to start trending on Twitter with [#CityCampNC](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23CityCampNC&src=typd). Warm up your tweeting thumbs and get ready for the kickoff to CityCamp NC on [Thursday, September 22, 2016](http://citycampnc.org/schedule/) at 6:00 pm. Doors open at 5:30 pm at [Nash Hall](http://citycampnc.org/2016-venue/).<!--more-->

Caroline Sullivan, Vice Chair of Wake County Board of Commissioners, will be our emcee for the evening. She has to help us wrangle a group of 10 speakers from various organizations on a variety of topics ranging from ending poverty with virtual reality to gathering insights on diversity from census data. Believe me, it&#8217;s no easy task, just ask last years emcee, City of Raleigh City Councilor and technology geek from North Hills, [Bonner Gaylord](https://twitter.com/bonnergaylord).

We have gathered an amazing line-up of speakers with a vast array of topics. Seriously, zoning, digital divide, open data, space-time visualizations, and more! We hope you&#8217;ll join us Thursday, September 22 for the free event that is open to the public, but [registration](http://citycampnc.org/register/) is required. Food and beverages will be provided, so be sure to skip out of work early for what&#8217;s sure to be an amazing evening geeking out with your fellow citizen hackers.
