Over at our table, Beth Stagner (Raleigh Web Services Manager)Â and Chris Geyer (Raleigh Experience Designer) showed us the wireframes that Chris has been working on for updates to the Parks and Rec pages on <a title="raleighnc.gov" href="http://raleighnc.gov/" target="_blank">RaleighNC.gov</a>. The current setup for their content management gives them a couple of template layouts to pick from, but they&#8217;ve recognized that some pages need a layout that&#8217;s more-tailored to the type of data presented. The wireframes focus on helping you find resources by location or by program (tennis, swimming) and help highlight the features available at each park (there are baseball fields, they have lighting, etc).<!--more-->

We also talked a bit about [CACs](http://www.raleighnc.gov/neighbors/content/CommServices/Articles/CitizensAdvisoryCouncil.html) as well. We agreed that we&#8217;d like to see the pages for CAC info updated &#8211; maybe to something similar to what&#8217;s now used for boards and committees (something [like this](http://www.raleighnc.gov/government/content/BoardsCommissions/Articles/AppearanceCommission.html)). Helping folks understand what a CAC is, find their CAC and find out about upcoming agenda/calendar items&#8230;

Thanks to Beth and Chris &#8211; they stuck with us pretty late have made some great steps in improving the site and the input process.
