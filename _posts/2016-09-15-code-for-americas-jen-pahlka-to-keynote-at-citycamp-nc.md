We&#8217;re very excited to get Jen away from her home in Oakland, CA and from the [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/) headquarters to witness the civic hacking scene in North Carolina first-hand. In June 2013, Jen took a year off from Code for America to gain some experience in the public sector. She decided to go to Washington D.C., more specifically, The White House, where she was US Deputy Chief Technology Officer for the Office of Science and Technology Policy. She is back at Code for America and will be in Raleigh, NC to talk to attendees of CityCamp NC on Friday, September 23, 2016.

[Listen to this TedTalk](https://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_pahlka_coding_a_better_government?language=en) given by Jen on the topic of &#8220;Reframing Open Government & Citizen Engagement through Technology.&#8221;

  More inspiration from CityCamp NC

In addition to our keynote presentation, we have several other speakers who will be offering civic inspiration and food for thought on Friday, September 23. We have speakers from Google, Panopticon, and Esri, as well as our self-professed “gadget-girl,” Lori Bush, Cary Town Council At-Large Representative and Technical Lead at Cisco, who will be our emcee. We asked Lori to bring good jokes, so be prepared. Speakers offering inspiration include:

  * **Erik Garr**, Regional Manager Google Fiber at Google
  * **Amy Gaskins**, Founder at Panopticon, Inc.
  * **John Yaist**, EDN Technology Evangelist at Esri
