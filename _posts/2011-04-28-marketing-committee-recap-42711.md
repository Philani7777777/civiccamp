The marketing committee met for the first time Wednesday and covered a lot of ground. The main purpose of the committee is to help communicate what CityCamp is all about, drive Facebook fans and Twitter followers until we have registration, and just get the word out. Key discussion involved audience and messaging. While this event will focus on technology and the high tech crowd, there is a need for citizen participation in the form of ideas and feedback. Messaging will need to be customized so the group is working on key talking points for each audience. Everyone took the action to show our current site to a few non-techies and get feedback. We&#8217;ll all bring ideas to Monday&#8217;s meeting and have any suggested rewording shortly thereafter.

Next were logos and other graphics. Christine has taken the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/fbx/?set=oa.143858052350397" target="_blank">first round of logos</a> to the next step and will be uploading those very soon. Once final, we&#8217;ll integrate the logo into the banner ads for placement at WRAL.com and other sites.

A tag line was discussed, and the general need to have a very clear and succinct description of the event continued throughout the meeting. Do we use the word government to describe the event since that word has such a negative meaning? Other phrases have evolved &#8211; from &#8220;Do it yourself City&#8221; to &#8220;Build the future of Raleigh&#8221;. If government 2.0 or &#8220;Open government&#8221; is the feature, then what is the benefit to the mass population?We&#8217;re all noodling on these questions and will bring thoughts to the meeting Monday.

Several action items were taken which can be followed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZp6kQYcmQi8OH_4Jw0-hl8EtgD3naYfKJ_-VPUm2Z8/edit?hl=en&authkey=CKWVuawF" target="_blank">master marketing document</a>.
