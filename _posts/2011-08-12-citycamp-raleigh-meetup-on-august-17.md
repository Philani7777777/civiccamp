After a successful 3-day unconference with over 200 attendees last June, CityCampers are finally getting out of the summer slump. Join us on Wednesday, August 17, 2011 at 6:30pm at Cafe Cattura for our first CityCamp Raleigh meetup.

If you&#8217;re a techie, govie, or a citizen who wants to create solutions for our local government, then CityCamp is the right group for you. We are focused on improving access to data and creating solutions that matter to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">us</span>.<!--more-->

We encourage you to bring your ideas. You can even <a title="Road Alert: Opening Up Traffic Ticket Location Data" href="http://citycampral.org/2011/07/road-alert-opening-up-traffic-ticket-location-data/" target="_blank">bring the roadblocks you&#8217;re facing</a>. Our plan is to have a mini, unconference style meetup, where folks can gather around their interests after some general announcements and business.

The web services manager from the City of Raleigh will be attending. So if you want to help improve the City of Raleigh website, this would be a great time to understand how you can participate. [See more details below on this topic.](#raleighwebsite "City of Raleigh website background")

We hope people from CityCamp Raleigh teams Open it Up, Use Open Source, EZ Riders, 5-Points CSA, and others will join us to provide an update on what they&#8217;ve been up to after the CityCamp unconference.

### <a name="raleighwebsite">City of Raleigh website background</a>

It has been a year since the City of Raleigh redesigned their website. In that time, we have revised search, content and information way-finding. This Spring, we added a new position to our web team to focus on usability going forward. The first section of the site we took a look at was Parks & Rec content, as we heard from the citizen advisory group that this was important.

Other steps we have taken in the past few months to kick off our new initiative to elicit feedback from citizen include conducting: usability studies, a website survey and collaborative design sessions with staff. As of today there is a new prototype for parks and program pages ready to share. We have also looked at designing better landing pages and to improve the look, feel, and usability of these pages. Going forward we are looking to gather your feedback and to get the word out about how <a title="raleighnc.gov" href="http://raleighnc.gov/" target="_blank">raleighnc.gov</a> will be changing.

Interested in participating in new designs for the site? We would love to have you.
