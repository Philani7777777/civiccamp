**Who is speaking on Friday?**

We will announce our speakers during our press release the week of May 14.

**Where/when can people register?**

Our registration is scheduled to be available the week on May 14. Be on the look out for a press release announcing this years sponsors, speakers, and registration for the event. You will be able to register at citycampral.org.

**How much does it cost?**

CityCamp Raleigh will be a **free** event. To register and attend, there will be no cost thanks to the tremendous support from our sponsors. If you would like to sponsor or make a donation, see our sponsorship kit.

**Can students attend?**

Yes. We want students from middle school to college and every in-between. If you&#8217;re a life long student, you might as well come too.

PS &#8211; If you are a teacher, principal, professors, or educator, help us spread the word and get your students civically active and engaged, with a twist of technology of course.

**Will there be a separate track for youth?**

No. We want our younger audience to be integrated with all CityCampers. We are trying to bring in some basic workshops to help lay the groundwork for new CityCampers. Things like, _What is open source?_ and _Who are the Digital Connectors?_

**What has CityCamp Raleigh done over the last year?**

More than we would have ever thought. We&#8217;ve helped on the back-end or influenced several initiatives here in Raleigh:

  * Two meetups post CityCamp Raleigh, one where Raleigh IT soft-launched their GeoPortal
  * Open government directive passed January 2012
  * Triangle Wiki launched March 2012
  * Successful deployment of GovDelivery (called MyRaleigh Subscription) March 2012
  * $50k (recurring) secured for open data portal April 2012
