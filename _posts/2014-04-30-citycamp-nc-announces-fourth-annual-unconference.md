CityCamp NC moves to downtown Raleigh’s William Peace University, which is serving as venue sponsor and helping to bridge education with professional opportunities during the event.

Jason Hibbets, CityCamp NC co-chair, notes that the three day, participant-driven event will begin with a new addition to the programming lineup to inspire ideas before the unconference and hackathon begin. “We’re excited to feature Bill Greeves, Wake County CIO, as our keynote speaker on Thursday evening, May 29, followed by lightning talks and a networking social at The Architect Bar & Social House in downtown Raleigh.” Thursday evening’s events will begin at 6:00 p.m. Registration is free for the keynote and networking, but is limited to 200 <a title="http://citycampnc.org/register/" href="http://citycampnc.org/register/" target="_blank">registered participants</a>.

The traditional two-day CityCamp NC program will follow on Friday, May 30th, beginning at 9:00 a.m. when unconference pitches begin at William Peace University&#8217;s Kenan Auditorium. Unconference sessions will be held throughout the day at designated locations across campus. Team submissions are due Friday at 5:00 p.m. Saturday, May 31st, is build day. Teams develop their ideas into reality and begin prototyping. Presentations and judging will be held around 4:00 p.m. on Saturday. For unconference participants who don’t join a build team, Triangle Code for America brigade will host a civic hackathon that is open for anyone to attend. Parking during the event is free &#8211; directions and maps will be available at CityCampNC.org.

&#8220;At the heart of entrepreneurship is innovation. By connecting the change agents with the tools they need to be successful, CityCampNC provides an avenue by which thinkers, dreamers, and doers can collaboratively engage in the process of making our communities, our cities, and our state an even better place to call home,” said Jenna Wadsworth, Wake County Soil & Water Conservation District Supervisor, and CityCamp NC attendee. “This is an event organized by passionate citizens who ensure that everyone who wants to participate can afford to do so.&#8221;

CityCampNC remains committed to delivering incredibly high participant value that is not dependent on hefty registration fees. Thanks to the generosity of many sponsors, including Bull City Venture Partners, MetLife Global Technology & Operations (GTO), Raleigh Economic Development, Red Hat, William Peace University and WRAL TechWire, registration for the unconference remains at only $10.00 for general admission. Government employees receive discounted admission for $5.00. Students with valid identification are free. All levels of registration can be completed online at <a title="http://citycampnc.org/register/" href="http://citycampnc.org/register/" target="_blank">http://citycampnc.org/register/</a>. Walk-up registration may be available the day of the event as space permits, but is not guaranteed.

In addition to sponsorship, MetLife Global Technology & Operations will participate in the lightning talks with Amy Gaskins, Assistant Vice President, Business Analytics & Intelligence as a featured presenter. For many sponsors and presenters, CityCamp NC is a chance to meet, learn from, and brainstorm with forward-thinking and like-minded people and organizations in the area.

As in years past, CityCamp NC will award a cash prize and venture consulting to the team that emerges based on votes cast by panel of judges formed of CityCamp NC organizers. The winning team will be awarded $3,000, 2-months of co-working membership at HQ Raleigh, plus a consulting session with Jason Caplain of Bull City Venture Partners.
