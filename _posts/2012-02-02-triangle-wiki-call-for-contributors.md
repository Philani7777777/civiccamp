The <a title="Triangle Wiki" href="http://www.trianglewiki.org" target="_blank">Triangle Wiki</a> is an ambitious community effort to document the Triangle – one building, person, and place at a time. Anyone can contribute content, edit content, or make comments because the site uses wiki software.  It’s community built and community owned. In preparation for the imminent launch, a **content sprint session is planned for February 25** to create as many new pages as possible in one day.

The Triangle Wiki organizers seek contributors in the following areas of interest:

**Knowledge** &#8211; Those with extensive knowledge of local lore &#8212; of a building, neighborhood, &#8220;effort&#8221; person, place or entire region &#8212; are encouraged to attend and share their story.

**Photography** &#8211; Each page of the wiki should feature a relevant photo, so photographers are encouraged to actively contribute to the wiki.

**Programmers** &#8211; Triangle Wiki runs on free, open source software called <a href="http://www.localwiki.org" target="_blank">LocalWiki</a>. Check out the [developer site](https://dev.localwiki.org/) for detailed instructions about how to get involved. Plan to connect with other programmers to help build features and look for ways to interface with the API.

**Civic-minded people** &#8211; How can the Triangle Wiki help local government and act as an innovation hub? This group can brainstorm on larger ideas.
