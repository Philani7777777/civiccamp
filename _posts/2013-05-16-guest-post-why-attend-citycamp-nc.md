On May 30<sup>th</sup> I will be traveling to Raleigh, NC specifically to participate in [CityCamp NC](http://citycampnc.org/). I am doing this because I have always found that the best communities are the ones that people participate in improving. CityCamp does this through bringing “_citizens, city government, and businesses together to openly innovate and improve our quality of life through technology._”

You see, we all use technology to improve the quality of our lives. You may check an app to see what the weather is going to be like as you get dressed. You more than likely use social media to stay in touch with family and friends. And thanks to things like Google Maps, when was the last time you held a paper map? The things we use daily help us explore further while keeping us close to those we want most.

But technology isn’t just about saving you from having to call grandma once a week. It is also about innovation and improving government. On May 9<sup>th</sup> the White House issued an Executive Order setting guidelines for opening government information. It’s an early step in opening data for people throughout the nation to use and manipulate. But why? As they rightly stated:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <i>Decades ago, the U.S. Government made both weather data and the Global Positioning System freely available. Since that time, American entrepreneurs and innovators have utilized these resources to create navigation systems, weather newscasts and warning systems, location-based applications, precision farming tools, and much more, improving Americans&#8217; lives in countless ways and leading to economic growth and job creation.- </i><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-"><i>Press Release</i></a><i></i>
</p>

This simple release of information directly helped you avoid listening for _Weather On The 1’s_, but it has also saved thousands of lives through early detection of severe storms and may one day lead us to better tornado warning systems.

Opening data and improving transparency in government, especially on a city level can lead to incredible innovations. From apps that can tell you where available parking spaces are located to telling you when the next bus is coming. It can also drive communities to be more civically engaged and take better care of their neighbors.

It’s this kind of thinking that made me interested in CityCamp NC. In one of the fastest growing states in the country, North Carolina, and specifically the [Triangle area](http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/), is blowing up with educated, creative and ambitious minds. Tons of people are moving to the area to build ideas and create lives for themselves. This is the perfect time to ask people just like myself who are relocating to the area: How can we improve our communities and our government together?

Got ideas? [Come join us](http://citycampnc.org/register/): May 30-31, 2013 followed by a Nation Day of Civic Hacking event hosted by Raleigh’s Code for America Brigade on June 1, 2013
