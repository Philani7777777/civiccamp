CityCamp Raleigh has put together a top-notch speaking line-up to kickoff the [first ever CityCamp Raleigh](http://citycampral.org/2011/05/raleigh-welcomes-citycamp-event-to-enhance-local-government-and-citizen-collaboration/ "Raleigh welcomes CityCamp event to enhance local government and citizen collaboration") at 12:00pm on June 3, 2011. We&#8217;ve gathered experts from government, business, and our local communities to energize participants on the first day of the event. The organizers expect the speakers to provide a working foundation and understanding of technology, transparency, collaboration, and open source in government while at the same time highlighting the importance of citizen participation.<!--more-->

Kevin Curry, one of the founders of CityCamp, will moderate a panel called _The Government Perspective_. Curry will explore topics such as how and why cities be should transparent and why citizens should care about technology in government. The expert panel will include:

  * Jerry Fralick, CIO for the State of North Carolina
  * Adriel Hampton, Gov 2.0 Radio
  * Gail Roper &#8211; City of Raleigh, Chief Information and Community Relations Officer
  * Mark Turner &#8211; Chair, East Citizens Advisory Council

Michael Tiemann, VP of Open Source Affairs at Red Hat, Inc., as well as president of the Open Source Initiative, will lead _The Business Perspective_ discussion. These experts will help us understand the role of open source in government and address why citizens should care about technology in government. Joining CityCamp Raleigh from our local business community will be:

  * Todd Barr &#8211; Alfresco
  * Bill Coleman &#8211; SAS
  * David Diaz &#8211; Downtown Raleigh Alliance
  * Jimmy Goodmon &#8211; WRAL.com

On Saturday, June 4, 2011 during the day&#8217;s &#8216;unconference&#8217; workshops, attendee&#8217;s will hear from Jeff Mooney, the Partnership Development Director at SeeClickFix and Joel Reyes, Sr. Dev Evangelist for Microsoft Public Sector US. Attendee&#8217;s will be welcomed by Raleigh&#8217;s Mayor, Charles Meeker.

That&#8217;s a glimpse of what we have planned. The most important part of the event will be the attendees and the collaboration that is bound to occur starting at the GovUp after the Friday session.
