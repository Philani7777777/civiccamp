[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-911" title="AdoptShelterApp4006fc48d" src="http://citycampral.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AdoptShelterApp4006fc48d-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" />](http://adoptashelter.raleighnc.gov)Do you know someone that can adopt a CAT bus shelter in Raleigh? Maybe it’s a business, a volunteer group, a school, a neighborhood, or an individual? The obligation includes a 1-year commitment to clean the adopted bus shelter once a month and report any maintenance issues to the City of Raleigh. That’s it.

There’s a easy way to get started with a <a title="http://adoptashelter.raleighnc.gov/" href="http://adoptashelter.raleighnc.gov/" target="_blank">new web application</a> brought to you by Code for Raleigh, the same folks that bring you CityCamp Raleigh.

Code for Raleigh is participating in a <a title="nation-wide campaign" href="http://opensource.com/government/12/10/accelerating-open-source-project-adoption" target="_blank">nation-wide campaign</a> that ends this week. Our goal is to have 20 new bus shelter adoptions by December 8, 2012. Can you help Code for Raleigh achieve our goal? Check out the app and tell your friends.<!--more-->

Adopting a shelter is easy and you’ll get a decal installed on the bus shelter to highlight your commitment. Get started with this two-step process:

  1. Visit <a title="adoptashelter.raleighnc.gov" href="http://adoptashelter.raleighnc.gov/" target="_blank">adoptashelter.raleighnc.gov</a> and find a shelter to adopt. Sign-up and adopt the shelter.
  2. Finalize the process by <a title="complete this form" href="http://www.raleighnc.gov/content/PWksTransit/Documents/AdoptaShelter.pdf" target="_blank">completing this form</a> and submit it to the City of Raleigh.

A <a title="complete set of sign-up instructions" href="https://trianglewiki.org/Adopt_a_Raleigh_Bus_Shelter" target="_blank">complete set of sign-up instructions</a> is available if you need more details. Each shelter adopted this week will help Code for Raleigh achieve our campaign goal.

More details about the Adopt-a-shelter program can be found on this <a title="Triangle Wiki page" href="https://trianglewiki.org/Raleigh_Adopta_App/" target="_blank">Triangle Wiki page</a> and on the <a title="City of Raleigh website" href="http://www.raleighnc.gov/services/content/PWksTransit/Articles/AdoptAShelter.html" target="_blank">City of Raleigh website</a>. On November 6, <a title="Code for Raleigh soft-launched" href="http://www.raleighnc.gov/home/news/content/CorNews/Articles/AdoptAShelterApp.html" target="_blank">Code for Raleigh soft-launched</a> the <a title="http://adoptashelter.raleighnc.gov/" href="http://adoptashelter.raleighnc.gov/" target="_blank">adopt-a-shelter web application</a>, providing a user interface to the shelter adoption program the city initiated in late August 2012.

On Saturday, December 1, citizens participated in the <a title="first ever Civic-a-thon" href="http://citycampral.org/2012/11/raleigh-civic-athon-day-on-december-1/" target="_blank">first ever Civic-a-thon</a>. The event was a chance for citizens to stop by and adopt a shelter, create Triangle Wiki pages about bus shelters, and for Ruby of Rails developers to fix bugs and add features to the adopta app. We even unveiled the R9 bus shelter adoption decal with members from <a title="Raleigh Downtown Living Advocates" href="http://raleighdla.com/" target="_blank">Raleigh Downtown Living Advocates</a> (DLA). <a title="See pictures from the event." href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.393082037433668.92483.121135191295022&type=1" target="_blank">See pictures from the event.</a>

Code for Raleigh will be presenting an update on our participation in the Race for Reuse campaign and on the adopt-a-shelter app to Raleigh City Council on Tuesday, December 4, 2012 during the evening session. Our citizens petition is first on the agenda at 7:00pm. Please join us at City Hall, 222 West Hargett Street, Raleigh, NC.
