The CityCamp NC unconference looked something like this: 80+ people, 24 pitches, 22 sessions, [1 awesome grid](http://citycampnc.org/2014/05/citycamp-nc-unconference-schedule/), and 7 teams competing for $3,000, consulting from Bull City Venture Partners, and 2-months co-working space at HQ Raleigh. Team presentations will be at 4:00pm today (May 31) in [Flowe Building](http://citycampnc.org/venue/) on William Peace University. The public is welcome to join us for the presentations. Here are the teams competing for the prize:<!--more-->

  * **Healthy bike communities** — Influence planning and healthy communities through real-time crowdsourced bike routes that people use, using bikes as transportation vs. recreation. Also influence upcoming Raleigh Bike share program.
  * **Wake County Trail App** — We will implement the open source &#8220;To The Trails&#8221; App from Code for America for Wake County. The application provides an easy to use map interface. It is responsive (works on desktop, tablets, and mobile). We would also like to add an engagement piece to allow users to post comments (downed trees, debris, tough climb, etc.)
  * **Raleigh Engage** — Building a  engagement website for the City of Raleigh on NationBuilder
  * **Raleigh Vacant Space Finder** — Mapping Raleigh vacant spaces with crowdsourced data.
  * **Joulebug Data Hack** — Looking for ways to increase Joulebug social activity
  * **Raleigh food corridor** — Digital platform to build out open source food corridor. Where people can share ideas, find info, and build out locations.
  * **Re-humanize** — Improve employment for ex-offenders.

This is also National Day of Civic Hacking and we&#8217;ve got a project that other folks are working on projects. One project is improving the Raleigh Fiber Website, building out the form and creating a backend database. Other project may come up throughout the day.
