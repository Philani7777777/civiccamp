If you&#8217;ve participated in CityCamp NC in the past then you&#8217;ve probably also participated in a hackathon. This year, as you can see, we&#8217;re taking a bit different approach to this event by teaming up with NC Datapalooza. A Code for NC code sprint, [see list of projects](http://citycampnc.org/code-sprint-2016/), will take place concurrently with the&nbsp;[NC Datapalooza’s](http://www.ncdatapalooza.com/) Datajam hackathon. We hope that this brings a whole knew opportunity for cross collaboration and open innovation.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It&#8217;s been a great partnership with NC Datapalooza, and we&#8217;re excited to see these efforts combine forces as part of NC Open Pass. #teamworkmakesthedreamwork
