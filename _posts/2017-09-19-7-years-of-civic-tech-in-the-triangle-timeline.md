The intersection of citizens, elected officials, and civil servants collaborating on solutions to solve community problems is creating a high level of engagement. This engagement is creating new opportunities and having a positive impact for the entire community (and beyond).

I previously wrote about the [last seven years of civic tech history in the Triangle](http://wp.me/p8xeOh-HM). And that overview was a fun exercise. Our community has accomplished so much in the past seven years and this timeline shows just an example of how community and government partners have advanced open government and open data in the Triangle. And what a fantastic partnership between citizens and civil servants we&#8217;ve developed. By far, this timeline is not complete, but its a great start and I would appreciate any additions in the comments.

Let&#8217;s take a look just to see how much we&#8217;ve done for our community.<!--more-->
