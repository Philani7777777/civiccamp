&#8220;This is an opportunity for the Triangle to participate in a nationwide civic event and practice regional collaboration,” said organizer Jason Hibbets, co-chair of CityCamp NC, an organizer for NC Datapalooza and co-captain for Raleigh’s Code for America Brigade. “Our ideas will only be limited by those who attend the civic day of hacking.&#8221;

NC Datajam teams are working on projects focused on health, education, and green energy. Teams that form at the CityCamp NC unconference are invited to continue their work at the civic hacking day.

Code for Raleigh, a Code for America brigade hosted in Raleigh, is providing an opportunity for Ruby on Rails developers to improve the Raleigh Adopt-a-Shelter application. Triangle Wiki is hosting a content sprint to update wiki pages and create new information about local knowledge.
