One of our goals this year is to highlight the power of open data and its critical role in improving and transforming our communities. And for the first time ever, we will have a mega-lightning talk on open data.

What is a mega-lightning talk? We&#8217;re going to give the main lightning talk stage to four open data program managers to hear about the state of open data. The catch is, they&#8217;ll only have 20-minutes. Essentially, our mega-lightning talk is 1 topic with 4 speakers in 20 minutes.

Our evening of lightning talks is one of the most popular parts of our CityCamp NC program. The speakers will offer us inspiration, insights, and share lots of information in a short amount of time. Each speaker will get five minutes, yes, only _five_ minutes to share their topic. This will be the fastest hour at CityCamp NC and it’s our chance to start trending on Twitter using [#CityCampNC](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23CityCampNC&src=typd). Warm up your tweeting thumbs and get ready for the kickoff to CityCamp NC on [Thursday, September 28, 2017](http://citycampnc.org/schedule/) at 6:00 pm. Doors open at 5:30 pm at [Cannon Room @ HQ Raleigh (16 West Martin Street)](http://citycampnc.org/2016-venue/).<span id="more-2285"></span>

We have gathered an amazing group of speakers with a variety of topics including STEM engagement, creative communities and storytelling, improving digital digital inclusion, and more! We hope you’ll join us Thursday, September 28 for the free event that is open to the public, [registration](http://citycampnc.org/register/) is required so we can plan accordingly. Food and beverages will be provided. We hope you&#8217;ll join us for what’s sure to be an amazing evening geeking out with your fellow citizen hackers.
