On July 13th, I&#8217;ll be hosting a Triangle Drupal User Group (TriDUG) meeting at Red Hat from 6:30-9pm. The topics will include Introduction to Views & Introduction to Theming. You&#8217;ll get to meet some great folks from the local Drupal community and learn about more about Drupal, an open source content management system powering website like <a title="whitehouse.gov" href="http://whitehouse.gov" target="_blank">whitehouse.gov</a> and <a title="opensource.com" href="http://opensource.com" target="_blank">opensource.com</a>.<!--more-->
